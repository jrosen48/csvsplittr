Today a reader, tomorrow a leader! Reading allows your imagination to take you places... These are some of the quotes around our room. This is a very special year for my students to begin their own passion for reading! We would love more books for our buddy reading time!
The more you read, the more you know!
My students are very curious about learning and soak it up like sponges. They come from low income families so the only books they have at their disposal come from our very small school library. With relevant reading material, they would find better ways to stimulate their mind, engage the imagination, and have improved think-pair-share discussions. As well as being low income, many of my students are part of our English Learner (EL) program. Having more books in their hands would enable them to practice their reading and English skills.


We have several opportunities throughout our school day for the students to engage in extended reading periods. First, the students participate in buddy reading during our center rotations for small group time. My students also have DEAR (Drop Everything And Read) time while I pull other struggling students back for more intervention. Finally, they may occupy extra time after assignments with reading. Since we do not have many books and our library is limited (and not a weekly guarantee), we have created some reading folders from prior homework assignments. As you can imagine, new books would give them the exciting chance to discover new worlds; as well as strengthen topics discussed during science and social studies.

Another teacher is in the room 6th period and I teach a writing class 8th period. Flanked on both sides, transitions are difficult and messy. Frustration is high and our creativity is curbed. 

My students come from around the world. Our school is 100% ESL. All of our students are immigrants and many are recent arrivals. As many as five different home languages may be spoken in any class. This makes for interesting and challenging situations. Our students are learning the English language and art is another language for them to express their experiences and feelings.  

I am requesting a brushwasher, brush cleaning bin, solution and brush preserver. These supplies will help us clean the brushes quickly, and neatly before the next period, saving us time, saving us money on supplies and assuring that the discomfort of being in a small school with limited space and resources doesn't unduly impact the creativity and experience these students have in art.  

Simple equipment can go a long way to make an experience efficient. There is something about not having to worry about cleanup that frees me as a teacher and frees my students from the anxiety that as soon as they begin painting they will have to hurry to have enough time to clean up. The rest of the student body will be happy to see the sinks in their bathrooms free of paint. I am sure the custodians will also be happy. Your support of this small project will make the difference."

In our school 75 % of our students are on free or reduced lunch and we have large numbers of students with disabilities in academic areas. As a Title 1 school in a rural, low socio-economic area, we have faced  many difficulties with  motivating our students and parents. I believe learning is supposed to be fun and exciting, therefore I am always searching for innovative and new techniques to  make learning  more engaging and fun for  my students. . 

Technology is very important in today's society and becoming increasingly important in education. Unfortunately,most of our students do not have access to technology except at  school and are very excited  when they are provided with it in the classroom. I would like to create two technology centers, utilizing I-Pads in which students can work on their reading,  math, and writing skills as well as become  more familiar with the use of today's technology. The two I-Pads will allow students access to innovative learning apps that will keep them actively engaged during small groups and center time. With the assistance of the I-pads,students can get various educational apps that will inspire learning, motivate creativity and assist them in understanding the materials. 

The use of the I-Pads will allow me to  meet all the learning styles of  my students and prepare them early for the use of innovative technology. With the help of the I-pads,  my students will be excited, engaged and enriched with knowledge."

Coming from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, many of these students have left their homes, parents, friends, and more to find a place of safety and success.

90% of my ELL students are considered at-risk for reasons other than learning English. Exposure to gang violence, family instability, poverty, and limited education has made learning in any language difficult for them. Most are living with different adults in the US than they did in their home countries; with new rules at both home and school, they may not have anywhere right now where they really feel safe and secure.

Though they face many obstacles, they have much to offer each other and the American students in our school. Each year, many students put on a Latino school dance, sharing their music and food in a way that builds positive rapport between the immigrants and the American students. This project will help them focus more on building their English skills and building intercultural relationships.

Many of my students struggled tremendously last year to stay in their seats, and this distracted from not only their learning but also their classmates' learning, as well.  Rather than focusing on this as negative behavior, our school district has partnered with a local hospital in a Trauma Sensitive Schools initiative, where we look for the reasons behind the behaviors and how we can best overcome those challenges.  

A variety of seating options will allow these non-English speaking high school students to focus more on learning than on sitting in hard desks for 8 classes daily without the language to communicate easily with the teachers and students around them.
Often coming from home countries with a 3 hour school day, or no school at all even, these students can work at a standing desk, balance on wobble seats or wobble cushions, or de-stress in a bean bag chair, focusing their physical energy in constructive ways.

The three resources I asked for are essential because of how the students will use them. The cubbies will be used for their personal storage and to begin their routine. The water table will be used for play which will help with their sensory stimulation. Lastly, the carpet will be used during circle time so that the students have a visual cue of where to sit, and stay in circle time.

Upper grade students also have more textbooks, reading books, ancillaries and other necessary supplies needed on a daily basis. These will help keep the students individual materials in one place and convenient for them to get quickly. It is also personal for the child and keeps the desks nearer and more clear of clutter. This will allow for students to have everything they need at their fingertips.

My art classes are 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students. I see approximately 75 students per day. The art classes I teach are part of their day called Rotation. Which means they only have 9 weeks of art class and they move on to another class. By the time these students move to high school, they haven't even had a full year of art. The last full year of art they would have had as 5th graders, when they only had art once a week. 

I'm trying to expose my students to the basics of art and give them the tools they need to develop their creative skills. Some projects I had in mind really need these basic supplies.

My students enjoy clay projects and we share the dying kiln at the high school. I didn't want to ask for a kiln through Donorschoose.org because I felt that we needed basic supplies first. 

I'd love to see my art students be able to do more projects that help develop their artistic abilities. I enjoy doing projects that involve perspective as well as cutting straight edges. We currently only have 12"" plastic rulers in our room. This is not conducive to perspective drawings or for cutting purposes. The paint brushes we've asked for are replacements. Previous paint brushes hadn't been taken care of very well by previous art students. This year I'm new to the building and respect for what tools and materials we do have is a very important value we are learning. 

Years ago art classes were cut from our school district budget. As a parent of students in our district and as an art teacher, I'm hopeful that will never happen again. This is another reason I'm seeking outside funding for our art room supplies.

Our school is 100% free breakfast and lunch.. Even with all of these facts the students love school. They want to learn and come in each day eager to learn and work hard!

The headphones will be used by the students both in the computer lab and at learning stations so they can listen to the story as they follow along in the book. My students will be able to listen to a story being read to them. Whether on the computer or through an audio book listening to the words and following along will help a student in both understanding and recognizing the word. Comprehension and enjoyment can only follow. Please help me to instill the love of reading in my students!

The donations you make will allow students to listen to the story as well as follow along with the words.
Nothing brings a story alive more than hearing it read to you. I can remember stories from my childhood and those that were read to me remain vividly in my mind. I would love to evoke those memories into my students. Being able to make a connection is still the best way to connect to a book.

Two years ago, our classroom became an action-based learning space and we never looked back!  Each day, each student has the choice of utilizing either a yoga ball, wobble cushion, or traditional chair to use for personal seating. 

Not surprisingly, the majority of my third-graders choose the yoga balls to accompany them through the day.  My third-graders are bouncy, exuberant learners and the yoga balls complement that!  I have found that the yoga balls decrease negative social interactions during instructional time (it's difficult to distract your neighbor while attempting to stay upright on your yoga ball!) and increase time-on-task behaviors by giving the students a way to express their energy appropriately during classroom time. 

While we strive to use the yoga balls safely at all times, 22 eight year olds plus 22 yoga balls times two years equals some yoga ball punctures.  We ask for nine yoga balls to replace some of our broken equipment.  The students will use the yoga balls as a replacement to traditional chairs. 

Yoga balls continue to give my third-graders a fun and active option to traditional classroom seating.  My students know they need to MOVE!  When they see that their need for movement is supported during instructional time, they feel confident that their learning styles are honored every day."

My students are dreamers and are only restricted by the tools that are provided to them in my class, but what if they weren't held back? What if you could be a part of their dreams and creativity? 

My 6th grade class is always up for challenge. It's my goal in the classroom to always try and create an environment where learning can be interesting and exciting. They do struggle at times and sometimes have difficulty with the curriculum but they always strive to persevere through challenges and obstacles. I am always trying to introduce new ideas and new concepts to my class, this year we began coding and building websites and they have struggled through parts of the process but they always come out with a greater understanding and a feeling of success. This project offers yet another avenue for my students to experience technology in the real world. 

Using the MakerBot 3D Printing technology, students can literally create anything that they can imagine. Once you upload a design image, the printer sections it out and builds layer on layer until the structure is complete. The students that are having trouble understanding math can now create their own manipulatives to aid in their understanding. Students working on a science project for the science fair can now create parts of their experiments using the printer. Have an idea for an art project? It can do that too! As a teacher, it opens up so many possibilities. I can make puzzles, design projects, use it for robots, create manipulatives and much more. 

There are over 1.4 million jobs available to those with degrees in Computer Science but only around 400,000 students pursuing these careers. Having a MakerBot in the classroom would not only introduce them to new technology and logic but will also inspire them to be creative and help them to engineer their very own ideas. By donating, you can be a part of their creativity and introduce them to a world where their future is truly open to new possibilities"

The resources I have requested will give my students a memorable classroom experience. The resources will also excite them and they will want to learn more about science and past and current events. The new Common Core Standards have the students reading more informational text and the Time magazines will help me accomplish this.

I teach them the math that is needed to be able to graduate. The students that I teach have been referred from the high school in the area for various reasons.

Many of my students are parents to their own children and while attending school are also working close to full time jobs. Since their time is stretched thin, they show up early to school and stay later when their schedule allows them to. I offer them work on the computer and book work so they have a choice which would work better with their schedule. For most math is not their strongest subject. 

My students will use these headphones on a daily basis.  Our school has moved to an online program that has instructional videos for the students to watch.  Many of my students can not afford headphones for their own, so they do not have that extra resource to fully understand the material. 

Receiving these headphones will be a major addition to my classroom.  With being a computer school but not having headphones for all of my students, it will not be a first come first serve to receive the only few pair of headphones I have.

To me, those two words means art is a language and I use that understanding to help my English Language Learners (ELLs) communicate through self-reflective poetry, narrative writing, and scrapbooking. This project becomes a treasure they keep long after they leave our classroom.  

ELLs are only facing a language barrier, but that can be tough in middle school. Many of my students can write beautiful poetry and incredible narratives, however, their true talents often shine stronger when they take those skills and create amazing projects to highlights their work.  

My principal allows me the freedom to incorporate many different techniques and strategies to help our ELL population, so I am always searching for ways to garnish high interest projects while ensuring the state standards and curriculum are being met.

Because my school believes in using a child's strength to help him/ her achieve at the highest possible level, I use those artistic talents to allow each student perform at top level. ELLs who are reluctant at the beginning of the year, become fully engaged by the end through projects like scrapbooking and symbolic mandala making. 
 

My students need scrapbooking supplies for a year-long poetry and narrative project they complete and turn into a scrapbook about themselves, which becomes a treasure:  Fiskars gel pens, special paper collections, and scrapbooking glue. Art is a language and my students love to draw, decorate, and create as part of a lesson. It allows them to demonstrate content knowledge when they take a poem they have written about any topic and format it, then put it in a scrapbook and decorate it in accordance with the project rubric. Students bounce ideas off each other and sometimes collaborate in the scrapbooking process, which lets the beginning level ELL students engage in social and academic language more often, which in turn accelerates overall language progression. The same thing happens when we create mandalas or wall murals based on symbolism or theme or any number of other literary elements. 

For a student new to this country, using fun and creative activities such as these to help support the language domains (listening, reading, speaking, writing) helps the student set new foundations for their education in a new country."

I had to lend my students my personal laptop and iPad and send some students to the library in order for all of my students to be able to complete the course. During this lesson all of my students were engaged and they were also having fun while working on the course. 

Having the projector in my class will allow students to use PowerPoint presentations when they present their projects. Having the laptop in my class will allow my students to have one more computer in the class that they could use when we work on assignments that require a computer. Since accidents occur I am also buying a protection plan for the MacBook air and for the LCD projector. My students also need color paper for their projects. The whiteboard eraser pads are needed to erase the board."

Having three Breakout boxes will allow our students to participate in interactive projects in all content areas using the free materials provided through the Breakout EDU website.  21st century libraries focus on collaboration and problem solving.  Breakout boxes utilize the materials requested here in order for students to work together to solve problems or puzzles based on curriculum content, which leads to the unlocking of the box.  The idea is similar to the popular escape rooms with the added integration of subject matter that students are learning. Content covers all subject areas (from book related puzzles to history to science) and age levels but incorporates other skills such as perseverance, inferring, critical thinking, and communication.

My students know high school can be rough, and for some kids it is so hard to come to school that eventually they stop coming and just quit. We know being bullied can change a students life. In January our Student Council had an anti bully essay contest and it inspired some of our students to want to begin an anti bully school club. They liked the idea of making a difference. We are at 84 percent free and reduced lunch and being located in the inner city, you can safely assume some of our kids have faced being picked on or bullied because of what they wear, where they live or anything else a bully uses to make kids feel less than others. 

The students are wanting to form a club called the Bully Busters. Our students want to design and participate in a new school club  that plans to have a positive impact on the anti-bullying message at our school! 

We have a group of committed students who want to work to make their school culture more positive and inspiring by working to bring an anti bully theme to our school. The kids feel this will impact how students talk and speak about each other. 

Students feel that having t-shirts that send a message of ""not at our school"" can make a difference. Having a t shirt to wear instead of the uniform shirt will make students read the message and want to share the message with others. 

Thanks to donors like you and ABC family, students have some options to make a difference at their school.

Students will be able to learn through concrete practice using the math manipulatives. The Double Shutter Tin will help students to build fluency in addition and subtraction of basic facts. Math fluency of these basic skills is crucial to be able to master more complex skills such as multiplication and division. The students will use the dice in dice and fraction dominoes to complete hands-on, engaging, math activities that will promote communication and collaboration with classmates. The foam fraction circles will help the teacher to model fractions on the board which will be extremely helpful to all of the visual learners.

Each and every student in this inclusive classroom setting is wonderfully unique, creating a diverse group of learners with varying interests, levels of ability, areas of strengths and growth, cultural backgrounds, sensory needs, and learning styles. 

A one-year subscription to Go Noodle Plus will empower my students to develop memory and fluency in math, spelling, and vocabulary while moving. These 2-5 minute brain breaks are necessary to help students refocus in the classroom, and help students get 60 minutes of physical activity each day! Both my general education and special education students will benefit from these purposeful movement activities.

These physical activity breaks centered on instructional topics will help my students get 60 minutes per day of exercise while still learning and practicing important skills and concepts!  Your support today will help me to take student engagement, behavior, and achievement to a new level. 

Not only does this project promote health and learning, it is also kid-inspired! In such a diverse learning environment, we are explicitly teaching our students strategies to focus and regulate their bodies so they can reach their personal learning goals. In our morning meeting yesterday, a student mentioned that moving his body helped him to focus, and asked if we could do more of that in ""Team 213"" (our classroom). This prompted me to research and request Go Noodle Plus. This is an amazing program that will help our children get 60 minutes per day of exercise while practicing important math and language arts skills!

Our reading class is finishing Wonderstruck by Brian Selznick, and use the art materials in the MakerSpace to bring the dioramas from the book to life with their own two hands and creativity!  Additionally, our students are very energetic and need to move.  A lot!  You can see this in the way that they are constantly fidgeting and trying to rock our non-rocking chairs.  Our media center's only seating option are very traditional, straight-back chairs that are very wide but offer very little in the way of comfort!  The chairs are unwieldy and do not move easily to allow students to work in collaborative groups effectively.

This situation offers unlimited opportunities to learn tolerance and teamwork while discovering new perspectives. However, our school and our families can't afford the resources we need to support academic knowledge and significantly improve student achievement.  

You would be proud to offer our fourth graders a field trip to the Natural History Museum. This visit will strengthen their knowledge about earth structure and clarify how the landscape changed over the centuries. Two classes would be able to observe rocks, gems, and fossils. Our students must learn about the variety of rocks that compose our planet as well the way geologists categorize them. Most importantly, on this trip, they will be able to ask questions of experts, take notes, and learn!

Over the years, the program has been traveling much more, so we have become more in need of cases for travel. In the past, we have had bad experiences of basses being damaged during our travel because we do not own the proper type of cases. In addition, these students are also unable to purchase better quality cases because of the economic struggle they face everyday within their community.

With these new cases, the basses can play on their own bass wherever they go without any damages occurring.

They want to read anything and everything we make available and keeping up with thirsty minds is always a challenge, both intellectually and financially.  I want my students to have the best and that includes the 21st century tools that will help them learn in new and innovative ways while providing the requisite skill set to be competitive as they move forward in their academic careers.  Their families are very appreciative of what public school in New York City can offer and our diversity gives us a richness that no money can buy.  Within our classroom we can share many cultures, foods, perspectives and insights. Rich minds need to be fed with resources so that they can continue to grow, and my students are most receptive to anything new that can enhance their learning environment. 

The color Nook eReader is an electronic marvel. Small, light, and yet so powerful in what it can do. It holds thousands of digital books and can go online to access newspapers and magazines on the Internet.  It plays flash formats so that just about any graphic or animation can be viewed.  Today our public libraries are offering books for download for free on this digital eReader and videos for children soon to follow.  It is an incredible development for the New York Public Library to offer this to the public, but one must have an eReader to be able to take advantage of this remarkable access. The International Children's Digital Library and the Library of Congress also have resources available to facilitate primary source investigations, but again, one must have the eReader.  I am thrilled to see our public institutions taking the lead in providing books as well as access to library stacks opening the gates of literacy to all in true democratic fashion. 

Our public institutions are leading the way in providing their resources to the public and the libraries are the visionaries in this endeavor. The key to joining their ranks in promoting literacy and democratic access must be accompanied by providing the necessary tools that offer access. This color Nook eReader is the very vehicle for accomplishing some of our educational goals so that we can at least allow our students to enter the digital world with the best literature and newspapers online."

My class consists of 25 students-14 boys and 11 girls. They are a great group to work with. My school is a K-5 school with over 50% receiving free or reduced lunch.

My students will enjoy having an iPod Touch because 1) it is one of the most advanced pieces of technology; and 2) some students may not ever get the opportunity to use an iPod Touch; and 3) they will get to play educational games while having fun. My students will learn how to use this advanced equipment and they will learn reading, math, science, and social studies skills while playing games. FUN, FUN, FUN!

Our school celebrated its 100 year anniversary this September. Many of our classrooms have the original wooden sashes between our rooms, beautiful wooden closets and the original hardwood floors. I fell in love with this school because of the old feel and the simple beauty the classrooms. I want to preserve this treasure. 

I plan on cutting a small cross into the tennis balls and have the students put the balls on the bottom of their tables and chairs. The last few years I have spent a day during the summer rubber banding felt to the bottom of all of the chairs in my classroom. By the time winter break rolls around the felt has holes in it and needs to be replaced. As a class we remove and replace the felt and this occurs 3-4 times during the year. I am hoping the tennis balls will be a cheaper and a more permanent solution to protecting the floors.

I am requesting an Apple MacBook Air. My students have limited access to computers at our school. We have 30 Chromebooks, that are shared per grade level. This doesn't give much time for students to work on projects, research, or individualized skills. Our District recently adopted a new Reading and Language Arts curriculum, and I was not provided teachers manuals. I only have access to them on-line. That is also the only way I can provide intensive workbook pages for my students.  Having a MacBook would allow me to read the on-line teachers manuals to instruct and provide curriculum to my groups.  The students would also be able to work individually or collaboratively on the computer for typing practice, research, and specific skills in all academic areas. The Mac Book enables the use of specialized apps such as ABC Mouse, Phonics Genius, Space Math, One Minute Reader, and many more to practice their academics skills. Apps also help to make learning fun and motivational, while keeping track of their progress.

My students have plenty of fictional work, but with my students having such a difficult time making connections with their environment due to their advisability, non-fiction is a necessity at this point. The next time I ask if a man can fly, I want the answer to be no. We just read a work of fiction (our basal) that has a man flying. Although it is a fun story, my children cannot differentiate that this is a work of fiction. I need to show them real magazines and science fact-based reading material to make that connection. 

My students are starting their educational careers at a disadvantage, but it does not have to remain that way. Help me continue to make those real-world connections so that my students can learn not just works of fiction but works that work for them. Thank you in advance for your generosity in improving the quality of education for those that need it the most."

Coming from music class the other day the students were all a buzz with a wonderful idea. They told me they wanted to write a school newspaper!

When we returned to class we had a class meeting about their idea. A discussion of what all would be involved in the process and publication of a school newspaper was held. Each student was excited of the possibilities  for learning and what jobs they would hold for the newspaper. They decided we would need reporters, photographers, writers, editors, and publishers. This was exciting to me because it demonstrated that they understood the writing process.  After school I discussed the idea with our principal and he approved.

I feel my students need to experience every aspect of the newspaper and to do this we need certain materials. The reporters will need a tape recorder to make sure they get all the information when doing interviews. The photographers will need to use a digital camera and accessories for the camera to capture events going on around the school. Then the publishers will use the photo lab and paper to complete the final product. The jobs will be alternated in each publication to assure that each student can benefit from learning new technology.

Our school is a Title One school and we need your help to make this classroom desire come to life. Our resources at the school are limited but the students' imaginations are not. You never know one of my students could be the next star reporter for the Charlotte Observer!"

If I had at least fifteen copies of this game, students could work with partners to build their number fact fluency.  These machines will also allow students to work at their own level of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even fractions and decimals.

The ""CAN DO"" motto is especially significant because I teach inclusion classes with a wide-range of abilities.

Working with students in high-poverty schools as taught me that they are appreciative of anything they are given, no matter how small. I would love to keep basic supplies in stock continuously, but it's difficult when you have to pay out of pocket as a teacher.

We are running dangerously low on basic supplies we use EVERY DAY - pencils, glue sticks, colored pencils, and scissors. It is hard to expect students to complete assignments when we don't have the supplies they need. Please consider donating to our classroom to replenish our supplies so we can continue learning! With the holidays coming up, they will look forward to continuing the remainder of the year well-stocked with supplies. Thank you!

We also serve a few students from a local homeless shelter. A variety of languages can be heard around the neighborhood. The community is very supportive and highly values education.

Each of my fifth grade students are hard workers. They try their best to improve on their math and reading skills each day.

(They are back-channeling to show active listening.)  Through practice, students will be able to sustain meaningful discussions about a text both verbally and writing online.

The students need a strong foundation in understanding place value which then carries over into regrouping, money, and other math skills. I have seen and even borrowed, some place value boards and blocks to use with my students. These materials would be highly valued in our classroom to use on a consistent basis. When the students are using their hands and learning in a way that incorporates several modalities they tend to think they are ""playing."" They have no idea that learning can be just as fun as playing, and that math is not just about worksheets. These materials could be used year round in our classroom. 

You would be giving twenty second graders an enriched education in math by being able to provide these materials. Each of whom would be grateful for the ability to practice place value in a new and exciting way."

Gifted students grasp concepts quickly and are skilled at higher level thinking. They are often bored in the typical classroom. They need to be constantly pushed and challenged. That is my job and I love it. 

My students think outside the box and are creative problem solvers.  As a teacher, I know that many of my current students will have jobs  that haven't even been invented yet. Even though we don't know what the jobs will be, we do know some essential  skills that  will be crucial for the future. Future workers will need to be collaborative problem solvers. The ability to work well with others is a struggle for many gifted students. The materials we are requesting will enable my students  to understand some basic engineering principles and allow them to explore several programming languages for  robots. My students can then use those skills to solve real world challenges as part of a collaborative problem solving team.

My students need the Zenpad 8"" tablets to program and control the robots we use for projects in our classroom. Unfortunately, the classroom chrome books we have do not support the programming apps we need. Students have had to rely on my cellphone for programming and it doesn't hold enough charge for two classes in a row.

My students need Think Fun Makers Studio gears, winches, and propellers to learn basic engineering principles. I have been using a maker space unit in my classroom but quickly realized that my students need some instruction and practice in basic engineering. The Think Fun products, along with the K'nex and Legos, will give students a knowledge base they currently lack.

It is an unyielding expectation that students have the capacity to accurately read a variety of texts and then reflect upon that material. While our students are making great strides toward that goal, at times their comprehension of non-fiction, informational texts is lacking. Our students often lack some of the background knowledge or  text-specific vocabulary that would aid in their understanding of informational pieces of writing. Additionally, our reading curriculum has limited opportunities to expose students to non-fiction writing. 

It is my hope this year to increase my students' exposure to non-fiction writing. With your help, I will be able to provide my students with a TIME For Kids magazine subscription. This periodical will dramatically increase my students' exposure to non-fiction writing, current events and text features (maps, graphs, charts). I have no doubt that this weekly gift will make my students more competent readers and citizens.

My students love the experience of carving in stone. However, the only tools that we have are my personal carving tools & I only have enough tools for 1 student to carve at a time. We have donated Bedford Limestone to carve, but need tools. 

My school is a Title 1 school with over 60% of the students receiving free or reduced price lunch. The school population is around 540 students and I teach Kindergarten through 8th grade art on a weekly basis. Students enjoyed various arts experiences. It is important that I give my students unique arts experiences to enhance their education due to the area that they live in. For many of my students since they live in a rural area it is important to give them opportunities, because they might not have access to otherwise. I want to ensure that my students not only see various processes and works of art, but they get to participate in a more authentic experience by doing these processes and various media.  

I learned to love stone carving a few years ago from a fellow teacher who was a stone carver. He told the story of creating a school-wide project where even the Kindergarten students were given the opportunity to carve and they loved it. We have been given various pieces of limestone from Bedford Indiana that are easy to carve by even using sandpaper. Also, a close friend who was a stone carver recently passed away leaving me several pieces of stone to use in my classroom. I have my own personal stone carving tools that I have brought in for the students to use and have the carving experience, but they are only enough for one student to carve at a time. I want the students to have access to carve when they want to without the limited use of only my tools. I also want students to experience carving in other types of stone and learn how to finish pieces through the process of polishing stone. Students who carve in stone will remember the experience and process for years to come. 

By funding this project students of all ages will be given the opportunity to carve in stone. The experience of carving in stone is unlike any other process that I currently have in my classroom. As I explained previously we have various pieces of stone that have been given to my classroom, but lack the tools to utilize the material. Once the students have the opportunity to carve in stone it will likely be an experience that they will remember forever."

Ereaders would allow the students the opportunity to also read the book to get the same information as everyone else. 

Our district is extremely rural.  We are in the middle of farm country and we don't have corporate sponsors to help us.  Our state funding has also been consistently cut but our students still deserve the right to a quality education.  The students in my room all have disabilities. They would often give anything to be viewed as normal, without any problems.  They try hard to learn and often will give up after many failed attempts.  This is when they start to act up in class. Given the choice, they would rather be like everyone else.  They want to learn.  They want to read.  They do not want a disability to hold them down.  The ereaders would allow them to get the information they need to succeed in all subjects. 

It seems like such a simple thing.  Picking up a book and reading it for information.  To my students, it is like trying to decode a secret language.  Some are able to understand the words but can't put them into thoughts.  Some spend so much time trying to decode the words that they never get the meaning behind them.  But, they are still responsible for the material in every class.  They can get some of that material through class lectures but a good portion always seems to come from the materials they need to read.  That is  where they start to fail.  Ereaders would help the students get the information they need.  They would be able to understand the complete picture rather than only the bits and pieces.  This would make a huge difference to them.  It would make the difference between a successful individual and a potential drop out. 

Without the ability to read, you are unable to do the word problems in math.  You also can not read the social studies or science book.  When it is hard to read, you spend all your time trying to sound out the words and then have problems knowing what was said.  Reading is one of the most important skills we teach but for some kids, they just never catch on.  Without being able to read, these students continue to fail and eventually just give up."

Since 2nd grade is the first year they are tested, we have a lot of pressure from above to help them perform.  My students rise to the challenge with every assignment I assign. 

My student's writing is getting better.  But they need more opportunities to edit each others work.  In order for them to be able to do this I must model it.  It would be so nice to be able to scan their work into the computer and project it on the board for editing purposes.  My students would be able to come up to the board and write the changes and take ownership of the new skills.  The scanner would also be used to scan in their books.  This would be super helpful during the independent group time.  I would be able to have the workbook or textbook page on the board so that we could do the problems together for mastery.  The scanner will also be used to share tests with the other students in the grade level and worksheets.  The printer will be used to print their computer work and also their AR reading test results.  The extra ink will be used to replace the toner when it runs out.  

This scanner will help my students to be able to see exactly what they are supposed to do and how to do it.  Having their book on the screen would make a huge difference and I believe they will improve in their test scores because of it."

My goal each year is to help my special needs students grow in academics and confidence.  In addition to students with learning disabilities and emotional challenges, some students are visually or hearing impaired, others have fine motor skills difficulties. To help them be successful, I need to produce individualized learning plans that accommodates for their diversity of learning styles and diversity in showing mastery of skills.  Having Google Chromebooks in the classroom would allow for their success through supplemental individualized instruction.


Having Google Chromebooks available in my resource language arts classroom will allow my special needs students access to high-interest, personalized instruction which will keep them focused and motivated to learn.  It will also be used to keep track of whether or not they are meeting their individual goals from their IEP's.  

Having access to the internet and being able to learn in a way that is suited to their individual needs will give them the confidence they need to succeed in school and in life!

The Chromebooks will also allow us to accommodate for our hearing and vision-impaired students, giving them access to information according to their individual needs.  

My students are amazing, and they work very hard to understand what is being taught in the classroom.  By supplementing the lessons with Google Chromebooks, the students will gain in academic growth and confidence which will help them become productive citizens in the community.

Our fourth and fifth graders are outside of the main school building in portable classrooms, and have to gather in the school gym when inclement weather requires us to keep them inside due to cold temperatures, wind chills or major precipitation.

Most of my students can't say this yet, but as our classroom gets more comfortable places to read they will begin to fall in love and experience the true joy of reading! 

At the beginning of the year most of my students hate reading. That's because they have never experienced the joy of finding books and characters they love.  The only reading they know is the textbook stories they've seen for the past three years in school.  Very few of them have ever picked up an independent reading book, especially not a book they chose themselves! Due to the lack of exposure to reading both at home and in school, many of my fourth graders are still reading on a second or third grade reading level.  By exposing my students to true, authentic reading instead of text-book reading they discover the value and enjoyment in reading. As the year progresses they find themselves wanting to keep reading, regardless of their reading level.  By the end of the year the 45 minutes we spend reading independently is their favorite part of the day! 

This is where we need your help! Getting truly engaged in independent reading means having a comfortable place to read. Having time to read independently at school is life changing for the kids.  I would love for ALL of my students to be able to find a comfortable place to read around the classroom instead of having to sit at their desks.  Being able to find a place to read makes reading different and exciting.  It also makes them want to read and keep reading.  We had three bean bag chairs in our room this year and they were always highly sought after - I wished  I had more. 

Please help change my students lives by giving us more comfortable places to read! School is about more than just passing a state-test, it's about a love of learning.  Nothing is more authentic than reading a book you picked out in a comfortable bean-bag chair. At the end of the year the time we spent reading is what they all remember."

However, having the tools to create this environment is difficult.  My students would love to be able to use an ipad to enhance their reading skills.   

My students will use this iPad in small groups, and as a part of our blended learning environment.  My students will read, play games, listen to stories, and answer questions about what they are reading.  We are using a computer program in the class, which can also be used on the iPad.  Kindergarteners often struggle with the use of a mouse, and the iPad will make using this reading program much easier. 

Donations for this project will improve my students' learning, by giving them another tool to read with.  Students learn in a variety of ways, and having an iPad will help students that need the tactile and engaging approach of an ipad."

The students in my classroom come from very different backgrounds. Many come from low socioeconomic homes where access to computers is very limited. Many have no computers at all or are not able to get on the internet. Some of our students are on a free or reduced price lunch program. 

One of the best resources that I have found this year is a website called IXL.com. This website allows our students to practice the exact math concepts that we are learning in class. The students will be able to use the iPad in the classroom to log in to this website. The students will also be able to have an unlimited number of apps available to them for math, science, social studies, reading, and writing. This iPad will allow the students to do so many things from reading a book to studying flash cards. The computer lab in our school is not always available for us to take our students to due to so many different district testing requirements. This iPad will allow us to have access to the technology without even leaving our room! 

When the students have had a chance to use technology in our classroom they get so excited. The world that they live has so much technology around them. They must learn how to best use this technology. This iPad will help me continue to get students excited and ready to learn."

""When you teach what you love and share what you know, you open eyes, minds, hearts and souls to unexplored worlds."" 

When my students enter my classroom, it is for the first time in a big, new school.  Our school holds over 1100 students, 1st through 8th Grade.  We are located in an urban and very diverse working-class community.  Many students come from low-income families, and do not have access to much technology at home.

Within my class there is a wide range of learners.  It is my goal as their teacher to have all of my students performing on or above grade level by the end of the year.  With the help of technology, I can better achieve this goal.

Currently, our school has a number of iPads and computers that must be shared with the entire school.  I would love to be able to use technology throughout the day, everyday, to help enrich the education I give my students. 

My eager first graders will love to learn together using the iPad Minis.  Their little eyes light up whenever they have the chance to play a learning game or take part in an interactive activity.  There are are a variety of reading, language, and math based apps available that will make learning *extra fun* in first grade!

I plan to use the iPads during learning stations and small groups, as well as during whole group instruction to enhance lessons.  The iPads will make it easy to differentiate instruction for all learning levels in my classroom.  Having iPads readily available will also help my students learn how to research topics  so they are prepared as they move up in grade level! 

It is so important to encourage a love of knowledge at an early age.  By using the iPads to enhance our daily lessons, we will keep learning fun and exciting... therefore creating lifelong learners!"

Can you please help me with this problem? This is a question that I hear every day throughout the entire day. My students attend a rural primary school that houses around 800 children beginning with 4k to 2nd grade. Each child receives free breakfast and lunch. Our community is a small farming community.  With them all receiving free breakfast and lunch, parents do not have the means to provide the resources and materials needed to improve their education. Sometimes, the parents are not able to help their children as well. As a teacher, it is my job to help my students become successful at school and at home within our community.

Calendar math will expose students to the following skills: learning place value,  number patterns, calendar concepts, multiplication and skip counting, counting money, and telling time. The students will use base ten blocks to show the expanded form for the number of the day and the place value flip chart will show the standard form of the same number. Students will use the magnetic money to count a collection of change each day. They will also be able to use the money to represent the number of days in school. The one hundreds chart will help students learn number patterns and identify the number before, after, ten below and ten above. The clock will help students tell time on an analog clock and then practice writing it digitally. Repetition of these skills will ensure that the students have a strong foundation in these skills that will carry on to the next grade. Having a spiral review each day will also touch on units that haven't been taught in depth but will give them a small introduction to that skill. Calendar math will also help students use these skills on standardized testing.

Bringing art from other cultures to my students is particularly challenging because their own understanding of the world is so small. Most of my 8th graders cannot locate our home state on a world map let alone imagine traditional art from Ghana.

In the past, I did the African Textile unit as a final project for my 8th graders-the culmination of their art experience. The kids LOVE anything that is hands-on, messy, and three dimensional, and they really throw themselves into these types of projects. This project helped them develop physical skills, build knowledge of design, and most of all understand the art of another culture on a very deep level.

I teach over 300 kids per year with an annual budget of $400. All year long, students ask about making 3-D projects. Last semester, I ended up paying for many of the materials for this project out of my own pocket because I knew how much they wanted to do something bigger. The African Textile project requires cotton cloth, dyes, and sewing materials to make the pillows. We use foam blocks and clay tools to carve symbols that will be used to stamp the cloth. We are also in desperate need of a decent class set of scissors that we can use to cut the fabric.

As we go through this unit, we study the design, history, culture, and traditional processes involved in creating textiles and symbols from Africa. All of this means very little to my students until they are able to create their own symbols of meaning and follow similar processes to make their own textiles. A hands-on, creative approach to this unit is the best way to make Africa real and meaningful to my 8th graders. Your support will bring world cultures to students who have never had the opportunities to leave home

The books that would be purchased from this project, like BFG, will be used to enrich students learning.  It also will help them to expand their worldly experiences, which is so demanding with low-income students.  Many of my students do not get the experience of holding an individual book in their hands during the enriched literature part of the whole group reading a portion of the day.  

Creating life-long learners through enriched literature is one of my personal goals as an educator.  Due to funding cuts, this is often one of the first aspects of the budgets that get cut.  Funding this project will allow ALL my students to hold a book in their hands while reading and discussing the novel.

The school is located in the west side of Chicago, one of the oldest schools in Chicago, and with 95% of student population in the poverty level.

As a math teacher, it is a challenge for me to promote reading and writing through mathematics.  Surely, one cannot detach math from reading or writing, because all of them go together.  How to incorporate them and find ways to enhance the lessons and their interest in order to increase their ACT and PSAE scores, and become useful individuals for this country, is the one great challenge that I face in my daily tasks as a teacher.

It is for this reason that I have thought of coming up with a Math and Science Journal project that would engage students in math and science through reading and writing.

The Math and Science Journal will serve as a mouthpiece, a student paper, for all math and science students in my school.  It will be through this Journal that students can meet even after school to draft, edit, proofread, and lay-out the journal.  There will be a campaign for student math and science articles such as student essays and other student write-ups, puzzles, quizzes, book reviews, pictorial activities and even teacher articles relating to math and science.  

In order to start this project, we need a printer that will serve to put into print the written articles and drafts, as well as pictures, that a student puts into the computer.  The class has a computer but no printer.  With a printer, then the Math and Science Journal can take off.

Dear Donor:  Please help me bring this project to life.  Please help my students start this Math and Science Journal for the whole school by providing us the printer we need.  Your donation for this printer will give my students, including reluctant readers, the opportunity to do something greater and more meaningful for them, because the Math and Science Journal, just like a newspaper, can motivate them further in enhancing their reading and writing skills-- and what a way to do it by reading and writing about math and science.

As adults, we love to play with technology and use it to learn and work. It increases productivity and uses less time. Students need these resources in the classroom the same way we need them in the workplace and at home. 

Second grade is an amazing year. So much learning, growing, and exploring happens here. These kids are hungry for knowledge and they love to be in the driver's seat when it comes to their learning. Technology allows them to do just that! They get to explore on their own in engaging and exciting new ways. Kids don't want to sit in front of a teacher lecturing all day (boring!). They want to be doing activities, collaborating, moving around the room and iPads are perfect for that environment. The best part is they can learn in a way and at a pace that works with their individual needs. Since my class consists of a variety of students coming from different backgrounds and having many different learning needs, I want to provide them with as many learning opportunities as possible. Our principals are so excited to get technology in the students' hands, but we just don't have the funding necessary to give every classroom the tools that they so desperately need/want. 

There are endless learning opportunities available on iPads, but here are just a few of the exciting ways I will use them in my classroom. 
1. Reading Centers- Students will be able to listen to and watch adults read books using online resources I have found. They will also be able to record themselves and others reading books and view them. These activities will help with fluency and other important literacy skills. 
2. Apps- More educational apps are coming out all the time and I can't wait to explore all of the possibilities. Last year I had a student who had just moved to the U.S. from overseas. She was having trouble with some English words and I didn't know how to translate them for her. I borrowed an iPad with a translation app on it and she was able to type a word in and it would translate to her native language. It proved to be an amazing resource because she could bring it with her around the room wherever she was working/learning. 
3. Kahoot!- A fun way to review lessons!

Our students all share one thing: they were bullied for being different. Around half of the school identifies as LGBTQ and the rest of them were bullied for being overweight, being the wrong religion, being too skinny, too goth, or anything else. Here, students are accepted for who they are and they are allowed to express themselves how they choose. If they want to wear a dress and heels today and baggy shorts and a t-shirt tomorrow they can. Because students are able to express themselves and feel belonging, students are able to learn and succeed in the classroom. A lot of work is done with students on creating a strong school culture that includes a no bullying policy. Restorative justice circles and methods for dealing with conflict are taught and used throughout the day to give students tools to create a culture where they will be successful. Everyone works hard to create a culture where students respect each other and their beliefs. 

I am asking for scales and owl pellets. The owl pellets will allow students to understand the structure and function of the skeletal system.

My school is a title I school with majority of our schools on free meals, free before and aftercare and living in non traditional homes. Our students are very creative, hands on learners. They really enjoy art and during our lesson the students find numerous connections with other classroom subjects. As a teacher it breaks my heart when we don't have the supplies need for our classroom. Plus other teacher relay on my classroom to have the supplies they might need in their classrooms.  

These resources will help use continue the hands on learn needed for our students at our school. Their is so much learning they can do but with out the basic materials such as paper it is just not possible.  It is hard to imagine how essential paper is until your classroom is with out it. We want them to make African mask, paper collages, and more. But we can because we lack the supplies. 

Without your help we will not meet our students basic needs. Paper is such a must have in every art classroom but with out the funding it will not be possible. This is your chance to bring much need joy to the students at our school."

My students are all native Spanish speakers and some are immigrants from countries like Honduras, Mexico, and Guatemala. My students are kindergarten and first grade English Language Learners. Most of my students' parents do not speak English, and school is the only place where they hear and practice using English. My students are hardworking and determined to learn the English Language. 

I am requesting 1 Apple TV, 1 cable, and 1 Apple remote to view projects created on the iPad.
Through Donors Choose my class was able to receive three iPads.  The students really enjoy using them to practice the alphabet, sight words, and even English.  But we also use apps like sock puppets to retell stories in English, Comic Book Creator to teach action verbs, and even create movie trailers to teach important skills.  The students can take turns watching the projects or presentations on the iPads, but it would be phenomenal to watch them as an entire group.  My English Language Learners could use their speaking skills to introduce their projects to the class, and we could enjoy them together.  As the students are ready to share their projects, the use of the Apple TV in the classroom will allow the students to showcase their work on the big screen for everyone to see. 

Your donation to this project will give my students the opportunity to explore the possibilities what technology can do for their education. The Common Core Standards emphasize public speaking, and this tool will help my students to hone their English speaking skills and increase their confidence."

Most of my students are English language learners. Our self-contained class is comprised of students with disabilities in second and third grade. 

At our school, we are always working on Empowering Students Through Art. My students absolutely love music and the theater. Their favorite thing to do when working with a complex text during literacy is to act out  what they hear to make the story truly come to life.  I want to do something special for them this winter season before our holiday break and take them to see Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer at Madison Square Garden.

Our school is a Spanish/English bilingual dual immersion school of 315 kids and they have music class two times per week for 30-minutes each time. The kids are K-5 and come from diverse backgrounds. We have a high percentage of low-income families and we are also a 70% minority population school. 

There are two different types of mallets being requested in this project.  One type is hard, red yarn mallets.  These work best on our smallest xylophone so that they are clearly heard when playing in an ensemble.  The other type is the medium, blue yarn mallets.  These are best on our medium to large xylophones and are a general purpose mallet.  I get very creative in working with student and xylophones trying to maximize their playing time on an instrument.  Your generosity will help us reach our goal of having a 2:1 ratio of students to xylophone in a music class. 

Students in K-5 all work on the xylophones during the year and I would like to be sure that we are teaching good technique and good habits with a mallet in each hand from day one.

This summer, I participated in a technology workshop that taught me (the otherwise technologically unsavvy) how to use Adobe Premier to create a digital story.  The goal of this program was to teach teachers how to incorporate technology into their classrooms, and more specifically, how to enhance the written word with digital images, a voice over and music.  

It was such an exciting experience for me and I couldn't wait to bring my ideas back to my school in hopes of coordinating this multimedia workshop with our two fifth grade classes.  I have since explained the tenets of the workshop to the teachers and my principal and everyone is ready and excited to take this on.  We all see this as a wonderful opportunity to engage our students in a standards-based language arts activity in a purely digital format!  

All of our students are from a lower socio-economic bracket and would not otherwise have the opportunity to work on their own project with a brand new laptop computer and an extremely expensive movie making program.  For many, the exposure to this kind of high-level technology will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

The problem we face is that, while we nearly have a class set of digital cameras, we are in need of the memory cards.  We received the digital cameras through a grant about five years ago, and in almost all of the cameras the memory cards are full.  Not many families in our community have digital cameras, and in order for the students to participate in this technology workshop, they need to take 20-25 photos that correlate with the theme of their project.  I would hate for them to miss out on this experience because of this small glitch.

We are requesting your support to purchase 11 memory cards for our Olympus Camedia D-100s.  Although it will take a much longer time to complete the project, we can use a few cameras with memory cards on a check-out basis.

This project has the potential to be one of those unforgettable academic experiences for our students and one that will allow them to utilize technological resources that a fiscially challenged urban school district, unfortunately, cannot otherwise provide.

The library is the center of the school and a hub for inspiring learning, and I want to continue to encourage students to come and seek knowledge.

The requested iPad with accompanying robots will help my students by teaching them coding and programming. Through programs and apps such as Blockly and Tickle, students from grade K-6th will learn how to program the robots and, through this fun and engaging experience, will learn computer science.

These items will help teach all children computer science and robotics. It will turn the library into a makerspace, a hands-on area in the school dedicated to innovation and creation. Through this access at the school level, all students, including underrepresented students will have an opportunity to learn computer science. Additionally, the kinetic sand and magnetic poetry will add diversity to the library centers and will add to the STREAM (Science, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) happening in the library.

I have roughly 90 eighth graders that read at a variety of levels. The common link between them all is they hate reading! Approximately 95% of my students come from poverty and the school is highly diverse.  One common factor is that most of my students have either never read a book to completion or wanted to read a book, due to lack of interest. I have had students read this book, who have never read before, and be excited to keep turning the page.  My goal is to spark this love for reading and get them interested in finding the 'right' book for them.  I hope Donors Choose can help my class get this opportunity! 

When we begin our novel study, we will read the book during class. Through activities and discussion, the students will learn the reading skills necessary to become better readers.  I will be using Common Core aligned standards to base the activities and skills being learned.

Since I have a many levels of readers in the class, Monster is ideal because it is written for early middle school and the themes appeal to the young adult. This is a sure way to keep all of my readers engaged.

With this project, I hope to get students to continue reading for enjoyment. Once students realize there are books out there that can be interesting to anyone, I can then work on students reading for enjoyment at home. 

This project will provide a great impact for my students who do not normally read or that find reading enjoyable.  Your donation could help fund the spark that lights the fire of interest for my students."

My diverse group of students do not fit into one box or one category. They are white, black, Latino, Eastern European, and Native American. They read on grade level, above grade level, and below. But no matter where my students are coming from, they are all hungry to be challenged. They are all hungry for learning experiences that are meaningful to them as individuals. When presented with the right books, they are all hungry to read. 

My project is aimed at creating a challenging, and individualized, learning environment for each and every one of my students. Inspired by the research-based writings of literacy luminaries such as Donna Santman and Harvey Daniels, I am seeking to create leveled independent reading groups that will allow my students to learn in small group settings, custom tailored to their interests and ability levels. In order for those groups to be possible, my students are going to need books ... and lots of them to choose from!

My students are smart, engaging, and motivated, but yet many lack the background knowledge to be successful as they possibly can be. They know that there is a future, beyond their obstacles they currently face. Each and every students has a passion for learning, and learning through the use of technology.  Many students here at my school, don't have the opportunity to have computers, tablets, and etc. at home.  So interacting with technology at school, might well be their only opportunity.

Although with all of the obstacles we face, we are a school where our students succeed and teachers like myself are dedicated to teaching. 

My students will each have their own pair of ear buds, which will reduce the sound of other students engaging in the class and eliminate germs that could be spread by them sharing.  They will now be able to fully concentrate whether on the computer or a tablet, the noise will be extremely minimal. This will help them focus on taking district computer generated assessments to researching topics for assignments. 

Technology serves as an outlet for my students to enhance their knowledge. Although at times due to 20 plus students engaging and learning in a classroom setting at once, it can become quiet noisy and distracting. With each student owning their own pair of ear buds; distractions would now become minimal. This will grant all my students the opportunity to engage in technology to the fullest extent."

It is important to me to provide and environment that is comfortable, homelike and safe. I have already created a reading nook with a pallet couch, ""stuffed chairs"" (chairs with pillow cases) and the kids love to snuggle up with a good book and began their classroom reading daily.

Many of my students have a lot of energy to let loose, they will do this by fidgeting in their seat or playing with their materials because they do not know where to send it. Having various forms of seating that is conducive to helping a child with ADD, ADDHD, or just your average rambunctious first grader  will increase their learning.

We as adults struggle to learn when we are  uncomfortable, children are the same! We as adults often will groan inwardly when we walk into a meeting and only the ""uncomfy"" seats are left! In our adult lives we are very rarely required to learn for 7.5 hours a day in a rock hard plastic chair! I always go to my favorite spot on the couch to work  read a book and watch movies. Our kiddos are the same. These seats will really help the students in sharing, taking turns and develop a love of learning. Maybe if I had a seating choice when I was in high school I would have liked Romeo and Juliet. 

The wobble, bouncy cushions and ball chairs allow a child to be in perpetual motion or still without making a sound. This allows their nervous energy to flow out leaving their mind free to focus. The Bean bags provide a soft comfortable ""safe"" feeling that put students minds at ease that may have had a rough night, allowing them to focus. When students are more comfortable they are more open to learning!

Many students benefit from being able to focus on the lesson when their core muscles are engaged in balancing in a chair such as this. The combination of these three learning tools will give my students opportunities to explore within their lessons and encourage them to love the learning process.

Most of my students have never experienced that feeling of having a story they couldn't put down.  I want to encourage my students to try more challenging and longer books by motivating them with graphic novels. 

My students are in kindergarten through fifth grade. They are all enrolled in a general education program at a high poverty, inner city public school. They are developmentally delayed, have learning disabilities, health impairments, and/or autism spectrum disorders. My students are clever, funny, smart, creative, and curious. I am one of their two special education teachers and support them in reading, writing, math, and social skills. Many of my students are reluctant readers because reading is a huge challenge for them. 

All of my students love stories.  Most of them love to read books.  Most of them are also daunted by anything longer than a picture book, even if a book is completely within their abilities.  By offering the comic book format of a graphic novel, I hope to entice my students to try reading something longer.  I have selected traditional and historical titles so that they can also expand their general knowledge.  My hope is that if my students experience the satisfaction of finishing a longer book, they will feel encouraged to try other chapter books in more traditional formats. 

In order to become better readers, my students need to read more and build their endurance.  My hope is that by offering a vast array of graphic novels, my students will be inspired to read more.  My hope is that these novels will be available for my students to read for years to come, but I would be just as thrilled if a few titles become so popular that they are quickly worn out!"

It will serve as an area for my students to sprawl out during independent reading, meet together in the mornings, and work in groups. 

I will be meeting my new students in the fall. Our area is very diverse with many different ethnicity's and backgrounds. The parents of our school are fantastic. Many of them are involved in PTA and they find joy in helping out our teachers. The staff at our school is phenomenal! Almost everyone is Gifted Certified which makes for a unique teaching experience. I love that everyone is willing to help each other and offer advice. I am very much looking forward to this school year.  

Last year I was fortunate enough to have a rug already in the classroom. The teacher before me had left it and I will forever be grateful. It was such a blessing and my class used it every day. When I moved schools I decided to bless the next teacher and leave it for their class. So now I am in need of a classroom rug. My students will be using it for many different activities. A comfortable reading spot, a meeting area for small groups, a gathering place to develop our classroom community and many other ways. As silly as it sounds a classroom rug is vital in developing a successful 4th grade community.  

At the rug we are open and honest, we support each other, and we listen and learn intently. A rug will help us stay focused and friendly. It will be an area where relationships are formed, between the students and with me, their teacher. It will be an area where questions are asked without hesitation and where new things are learned. We would love your help in getting us this necessity for our classroom."

My school works incredibly hard in the community to meet the needs of our students. Although many of those needs are met, some of our needs can never be met due to many situations, like lack of funding. Students at our school receive breakfast and lunch at no cost. 

My students currently learn about music by singing from a book or listening to it by CD or websites like ""Youtube"". The recorders and method books I'm requesting will give students the opportunity to learn how to read music from as an instrumentalist. They will also have the opportunity to perform a special selection with the local symphony, later on in the school year. It's not everyday an elementary student gets to perform music with a symphony. This will be really exciting for many of them.

My students often express their interest in playing a musical instrument. Everyday, they ask with much anticipation, ""when can we learn how to play an instrument?"" I know that these recorders will ultimately spark their interest in music, which will keep them motivated to come to school.

They can often be seen rocking back and forth, standing, leaning, or even climbing on the backs of theirs chairs seeking sensory input.  They need help to increase their stamina during the day and stimulate their intellectual development. 

My class consists of 23 active second graders in a suburban public elementary school.  Our school corporation's mission states that ""children will be provided with customized 21st century experiences that ensure student growth"".  The stools I am requesting for my class would allow for this growth to happen. The children in my class are ages 7-8 and can be described as kinesthetic learners.  Kinesthetic learners have a lack of focus and the inability to sit or stand still for a long period of time.  According to research (Fliess, 2008), all children are this type of learner until at least age 7 or 8.  Other research has shown that these individuals acquire knowledge better when movement is involved (Hutton, 2008).  My 23 current and future students will benefit from this project. 

The stools would be used at each child's desk.  The current seating in our classroom is stationary, uncomfortable, and rigid.  I have observed that my students need multiple breaks during the day to stay on task which interrupts instructional time.  The Hokki stool will allow my students to sit and be active at the same time.   The innovativeness of the stool will also fulfill the needs of our corporation mission statement. 

The Hokki stools are unique in that they transform stationary sitting into an activity.  The children are moving even whey they seem to be sitting still.  They have a convex base allowing for movement along with a stable, durable base for safety.  My students will be able to engage in movement while working which is critical to their development.  Time on task in all subjects areas will increase along with student stamina and achievement."

New York City can get pretty cold in the winter months.  Most of my students travel over an hour to get to school often waiting at a cold bus stop or trudging through snow covered streets. Let's help make this daily commute to school easier by keeping their ears, heads and hands warm and dry. Research shows that student attendance declines in the winter months, a trend often attributed to cold temperatures. If students aren’t in the classroom, they cannot learn and quickly fall behind.  Providing students with hats, scarves and gloves can help boost attendance – a key ingredient in raising student achievement.

Our students have very little experiences outside their community. I believe it is because of this that their word choices seem to be very limited when they write. 

We would like to have a classroom set of thesauruses for our students to use. It has become very important that a large portion of our language arts instruction revolves around writing skills.  It would be terrific if each student could have a thesaurus at their desk so when they are trying to revise their writing pieces they have a tool to help them expand their word choice.  Our students tend to use the same adjectives over and over in their writing.  They also do not create very detailed images when writing.  Hopefully, learning to use a thesaurus could help solve both of those issues.

Of the proficient English students many have parents that speak Spanish at home and are not able to help them practice reading skills.  Our school district requires teachers to work with the English language learners separately for 45 minutes daily.

We live in a world where technology is at the forefront. Children need to know how to use, manipulate, and understand how technology works because it will be their future. Funding this project will allow third graders to use iPads throughout their daily learning and understand that technology can benefit their lives. They will use these to develop math skills, build a deeper bed of knowledge in other disciplines, and demonstrate mastery by creating end projects.

IPads will allow my students to become 21st century learners and understand how to use technology as a tool, as opposed to just a platform for gaming. As quoted from Ira Wolfe, ""65 percent of today’s school children will eventually be employed in jobs that have yet to be created, according to this U.S. Department of Labor report."" That's amazing and scary! These jobs will need a foundation in technology and will require 21st century learners to fill them. By funding this project, you will directly have a hand in shaping the future of an outstanding group of third graders. You will help them to build their foundation for the future. The addition, these 2 iPads will have in my classroom, will allow for technology to pave the way for their instruction, build problem solving skills, and develop collaboration with peers. 21st century learners won't just be coming soon, they will have arrived!

Every morning I am greeted by 24 smiling faces who work hard to learn as much as they can.   

Our reading block is one of our most important times of the day.  During this time, the students learn to read by reading by themselves, reading with a partner, and listening to books.  I provide a lot of the third because audio books are a powerful tool.  

Did you know that Meryl Streep has done a wonderful rendition of ""Dr. Desoto"" by William Stieg? Have you ever listened to any of the ""Harry Potter"" books on audio?  These actors can really make books come alive for children.  Audio books are a wonderful way to ""hook"" children and make them realize the magic within the pages.  

Your contribution would help step our listening center into the 21st century. Imagine the old way - four children clustered around a cassette player wearing headphones. One student inevitably is playing with the volume and the others are howling and ripping off their headphones. At some point, I will be called over to fix the player or unwrap the cassette tape from the player only to discover that it is ruined now. Now picture four students kicking back in their own space enjoying a good book."

Therefore, this sound and art kit will make a great impact on my students.   

My goal for this project is for my students to understand how we hear through sound waves and how the ear works. This kit will offer various methods for students' mastery of how sound travels through sound waves and what the various types of sound waves mean. This kit will offer various lessons, one that includes the ear, the parts of the ear, and how we hear.  

The sound kit and art supplies will be used during the teaching of my sound unit. The tuning forks, rulers, and nails will be used to teach vibrations. The string and cups will be used to demonstrate how sound travels. The students will research how the ear looks and works through research on the iPad. After researching, students will use the modeling clay to recreate the model of the ear and will then paint the ear using different colors to illustrate the different parts. Using our iPads, students will create a news report to teach other students about sound, how it travels, and how we hear.   

This project will give my students a hands-on learning approach to our sound unit. Not only will it be hands-on, but technology oriented and offer creativity as well. Students will be able to ""see"" how sound travels to fully understand this concept."

With an outstanding daily attendance average of 98%, students at our school strive for excellence, and they are pushed by rigorous curriculum and high expectations.
This is their first year incorporating visual arts into our community at AF and our 9th graders are the first at AF to experience a well-rounded arts education. Some are experiencing art for the first time in their lives. They are eager to try new things and are excited to get out of the constraints of their general academic courses. They are beginning to learn to understand themselves in a different way through sketch booking, project-based assessments, interesting problem-solving, and new media. Our school is extremely excited and supportive to build a solid arts education and is finding ways to challenge our students to indulge in their passions and explore their interests beyond the norm. 

One of the biggest frustrations for an artist, and a student artist is not being able to work past a certain point in a 45 minute period if a section or area of a painting has not fully dried in order to continue to make improvements. As an artist and art educator I too have been in situations where I needed to be a bit more patient with this process. However, dryer guns will help speed up this process! With two dryer guns, we will be able to speed up the drying time by at least half and continue to experience more art making with better results!  

By purchasing these dryer guns, I hope to be able to cover more art making practices by speeding up the drying process to help students understand the process of layering and how it helps create depth in a painting. Painting isn't an easy task, but a dryer gun has major benefits to time restrictions."

I teach in a school located in an area of low economic development. The students are often English Language Learners and my class consists of students who have already been identified as Gifted and Talented. They are creative, curious and courageous!

Unfortunately the way education has become so standardized today, art activities are falling by the wayside. I think it's really important to teach kiddos how to be creative--one of the best ways to do that is through art. Not to mention the fact that the kids enjoy it and have fun learning. 

We do a lot of projects in my class. We tape paper underneath the tables and paint like Michelangelo. We look at paintings like Starry Starry Night and envision what ""Snowy, Snowy Day"" would look like in Van Gogh's hands. Claymation is a format we use to make stories come to life! I often have them create something and then write about it, so we are still hitting the required objectives.

We would use the paint, paintbrushes and paper to create masterpieces like the art masters. The blank books would be used for the students to write their own autobiographies. The clay would be used to make stop-action movies with characters the students have created. All the materials would help us teach the kids how to think more creatively. 

Help me keep art alive in the classroom! It's such an important aspect of teaching the whole child. It's a great way to encourage creativity and outside the box thinking-every product turns out different and expresses that child's voice. I have seen students who struggle with reading and writing, but feel their confidence restored in doing art. Not only do they love making the projects, but it's teaching them important lessons as well! Thank you!"

We start each class period viewing CNN Student News in order to focus students quickly and ""get them thinking"".  Our classroom activities involve reading, writing, speaking, listening and viewing, so the need for good audio to go along with our computers is paramount.  Each one of our students has their own school-issued laptop, so student developed presentations and assignments are the routine.  Good quality computer speakers are needed.  

I sponsor a Pep Club that meets each Friday and our goal is to foster and support school activities.  This club is very popular from year to year.  Students design spirit banners for sports activities, produce commercials and videos via the Internet  and design banners and signs announcing upcoming events.  We focus on persuasive writing techniques and visual presentation.  The students need paint!

Pencils and markers are incorporated into everything we do!

The high school I teach at is the largest in the state of Oregon (3,100 students), and our district has the highest poverty rate in the Portland-Metro area. Because our school is so large and diverse, it is very easy for students to get lost in the crowd. Many of my students go from class to class without any real connection to their teachers, peers, or what they are learning. Because of our high poverty rate, many of my students have been forced to step in the role of a parent for their younger siblings, or have had to get a job to help their family financially. Most of my students have never had the opportunity to just be a kid. 

My students SIT in their classes 340 minutes per day, five days per week. As a health teacher, this concerned me. At the end of last school year I began incorporating strategies where students got up and moved around while learning in class, and their engagement went through the roof! When talking with my students at the end of last year I asked for suggestions to make my health class better for this upcoming school year. One of the common themes was more opportunities to move while learning. They brought up an interest in exercise ball chairs and exercise bikes to use in my classroom. 

I believe these resources will help my students focus on what they are learning while being ACTIVE! The Zenergy Ball Chairs will be excellent for my students who get tired of sitting all day, as well as help them improve their core strength.

It is also a constant challenge to find activities to keep the children engaged and to make learning fun and interactive.  One of the ways that I help keep them engaged is through the use of reading rods. They use the reading rods to build words as well as sentences.
     
The Reading Mentor uses the reading rods to help students create words or sentences. They are able to build the words with the rods and then feed the rod through the reading mentor. The machine then shows their word on the screen and then reads the words back to them. They are also able to make sentences with the reading rods. The children can create words or sentences using activity cards or can make their own word and sentences. It allows them to build, hear and see the words on the screen.

It would be a great visual and tactile ways for my students to work on learning their words. 
     
The students will also have spelling tests in second grade. This would be a great way for them to practice making their spelling words before they are tested on them. They would work with a partner who would call out the words as they build them with the blocks and then feed the spelling word into the machine to see if they spelled it correctly. All of my students would benefit from the use of this center in our classroom.

The resources requested will allow us to continue to increase their reading comprehension skills, create poetry and spoken-word projects, and develop media productions for our project-based learning focus.  Their reading, writing, performances and films allow them numerous opportunities to demonstrate their ability to collaborate, to think critically & creatively, and to communicate effectively. Due to budget constraints, it is very difficult to obtain the supplies and equipment necessary to develop and complete our projects.

We do not have a technology teacher in our school due to funding so it is left to the classroom teachers to teach students everything they need to know about typing, researching, etc.  

I am requesting 2 iPads that I will use to help students get acclimated to using the Internet (sometimes a big struggle for them), and other applications. I have a class blog that I started for my students to integrate technology into reading. My class is learning basic typing by blogging, but it is hard to do frequently enough to make a difference with only 4 computers and 29 kids. I often try to allow my students to work in groups for projects that are presented in front of the class and an iPad camera would help to capture some of those moments and allow student reflection. I teach US history and I can see a camera such as this being used for interviews and other projects. It is user friendly and something my students would enjoy learning to use.
 
My students need these iPads to help them learn basic 21st Century technology skills and apply them to other areas like reading, math, social studies, and science. 

Donating to this cause would make a HUGE impact on our students. Coming from low income families, this would give them incentive to be excited about school. With the lack of technology in our school, having tools like these at our fingertips would be amazing. They will be learning basic technology skills while learning content at the same time."

Without comprehension skills, scholars will never be able to successfully accomplish their hopes and dreams.  Scholars in Detroit are coming into schools several years behind.  My hope is to see my incoming 5th graders achieve 2 years growth over a one year span. 

My scholars aspire to become actresses, doctors, business people, and so much more.  They have huge hopes and dreams.  Unfortunately, many schools and families in Detroit suffer due to ongoing socioeconomic issues.  Many scholars come to school hungry or tired.  They face problems at home and hide those problems during the day.  The most amazing part, is that they come to school everyday ready to face the day, ready to learn more than they knew yesterday, and ready to reach their highest goals.
Our school is here to help fill the achievement gap our scholars are experiencing and get them to and through college.  
The teachers at our school are dedicated to our scholars in hopes to see everything Detroit is capable of revealed by our shining scholars.   

My students need Reading Comprehension Activities, Reading Comprehension Games, Inferencing Centers, and other comprehension activities to practice the reading skills. Having these comprehension resources in the classroom will help scholars expand their ability to use the skills they learn.  Scholars will be able to practice their skills by using these resources as centers and during extra time they may have during the day.  It is easy to teach children how to read, it is much harder to teach them how to understand what they are reading.  By giving them multiple opportunities to think about their reading, scholars will be able to understand what they read in any aspect of life. 

We have very limited supplies and resources at our school.  These scholars deserve the very best.  All donations to this project will help scholars become better readers and lifelong learners.  Scholars must be able to read and understand what they have read in order to be successful in their lives."

I have a group of young boys and girls that absorb concepts and skills like a sponge. They enter my classroom each day ready to learn, and filled with excitement of what the day will bring. They are at a very critical time in their life, the beginning stage of reading and math. Their focus should be on learning, rather than what they don't have or what they need. Our rural school is nestled in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky. We believe that the keys to the future lies within the minds of our children. 

The materials I am requesting include probability cards, numbered dice, square tiles, and other hands-on materials that will engage students in the learning process. Students will use these materials during centers and whole group instruction to experience first grade math skills in a concrete manner. These skills include addition, subtraction, money, measurement, and other key skills. They need concrete-to-representational-to-abstract sequence of instruction to ensure they truly have a thorough understanding of the math concepts/skills they are learning. My concrete learners like a hands-on approach. They don't want just to read about an experiment; they want to do it. My students with ADD usually learn better by concrete methods. These materials allow me to meet their needs in the process.  

Donations to this project will improve my classroom. It will provide my classroom with much needed hands-on materials to address the needs of the concrete learner. Research shows when students who have math learning problems are allowed to first develop a concrete understanding of the math concept/skill, then they are much more likely to perform that math skill and truly understand math concepts at the abstract level."

  Learning to write is so important. As writers, we have learned that words can be powerful; They can evoke a mood, inspire a nation, make us laugh, and touch our hearts. 
  Second Grade is such an amazing year. This year my students will learn to take their writing through the publishing process of create, write, revise, edit, and ultimately publish. 
    As my students become more aware of the writing process they know that the books they read have typed words. To actually publish a book means to create a concept for a story and take it all the way to fruition. As my students learn to stretch their writing skills, it would be wonderful to offer them the opportunity to actually type and print out their own stories and books. Therefore, I am requesting a laptop computer, a printer, ink, and paper to help my students get published.
 

I work hard every day to ensure my students learn to love writing. I want my students to be empowered writers who understand that their words can be shared and understood by the world.

The program has a simple name -- Morning Program, but we hope that the results of this program will be both positive and productive throughout the year. The Morning Program at our school is scheduled to meet every Monday and Thursday.  We will meet in the gym from 9:05-9:25.
 
The goals of the Morning Program are: To begin the students and staff's day in a positive way; to use music, speakers, and presenters to motivate students to achieve their best; to recognize the good efforts of individuals or classes in the school; to provide opportunities for the students and staff to be exposed to various character traits, and good role models; to open doors of the school to the community, providing them a chance to see the school as a friendly place and; to help the students and staff in the school learn to respect the rights and opinions of others.

We have a diverse population at the Delaware Community School. A large number of our students receive free lunch. In addition to a traditional education program, we also have a Dual Language Program (serving students in grades K-5) that is composed of bi-lingual professionals, many of whom are from Ecuador, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Italy and the United States. Because of their backgrounds, the teachers share their cultural heritages with the children, helping them to better achieve a multicultural awareness. The desired outcome of the program is that both populations of students enrolled in the program -- native English-speaking students as well as native Spanish-speaking students -- become bilingual and bi-literate.

We strongly believe that the Morning Program will foster the importance of academics, as well, as positive values and attitudes.  In addition, the Morning Program will build stronger positive interactions and feelings among the entire school community: parents, students, and staff.

We look forward to joining as a school community every Monday and Thursday to begin our staff and students' day on a positive note. We will incorporate songs, students' presentations, and guest speakers, in English and Spanish, to help the school community to better achieve a multicultural awareness. In order to run the program successfully we need the following items:

*	Jumbo Height-Adjustable Cart
*	Two-way Adjustable Chart Stand
*	Two-Sided Original ""Plus"" Pocket Chart
*	Pack of Transparencies (50)
*	Box of Wet-Erase Markers

Last week my students advocated for their own learning and asked me to help them raise the funds for many new materials in our classroom for them to be able to use daily. 

Together as a class, they have been brainstorming ways in which we can advocate for more movement throughout the school day and each of these materials made the list!   

They have requested Kindle Fires, cases in order to travel with the devices outside, alternative seating for movement while learning, and recess equipment to be used daily! My students have asked for the Kindle Fires for our classroom so that they can make fitness videos to share with their classmates as well as classrooms in our school in order to promote physical activity throughout the school day. My students have also asked for wobble seats for alternative seating in our classroom. This alternative seating will help many of my students get their wiggles out and work on core strength all while being active learners. My students have requested recess equipment in order to promote more physical activity at recess for all students daily. All of this equipment will help my students meet their goal of being active for at least 60 minutes a day!

Children should not have to sit and work all the time without movement.  Movement isn't always playing.  Sometimes it is just necessary.   

My students are awesome!  They are very diverse in learning levels, behaviors, and needs.  They are unique individuals with unique needs. I do have a lot of students who come from a low socioeconomic home.   Our school is a Title I school, but we are very blessed.  We have a clean, safe building.  We have a great staff.  We also have a great parent support group.  We are not properly funded, but who is any more?  We always meet important needs, but there is never extra money for things such as standing desks or tables.   

These tables would be placed in the back of the classroom, behind the regular desks that students sit at.  This would allow the standing students the freedom to move around as needed without disturbing the class.  Currently, all students sit at small desks, in all classes.  Many of them are okay to sit all day, and then there are those who cannot.  These students squirm, stand and lean over their desks, perch on their feet in their chairs, pace or rock back and forth, and there are a few who get so frustrated that they will sit in the floor.   

Research shows that many students cannot sit still and when forced to do so, their academics suffer.  They shut down or engage in something other than what we are doing in class.  I strongly believe these standing tables will allow my students (who need them) the freedom to move while staying engaged in class.  I expect to see more participation in class and an increase in some grades."

My classroom is comprised mostly of sophomores who are larger than life with energy and activity.  We have a huge state test that dominates the curriculum, but with that said I incorporate at least two trials (John Scopes & Rosenberg's) per year that allow them to recreate the time period.  Last year there was so much interest I even introduced a third trial on President Nixon.  Watching them become part of the process and not just a bystander makes learning so much more enjoyable. 

A few years ago a parent allowed me a camera to tape the action in the courtroom.  This generation is amazing because they love to be recorded and see themselves in action.  Now we have software where we can make movies and summarize the events of the trial with their participation.  That feedback and instruction has been so integral in attaining student cooperation and involvement. 

A former student who now attends Kentucky State contacted me this year and thanked me for the mock trials.  She said in her criminal justice class she now had the confidence to stand in front of her peers due to her experience as a lawyer in US History.

Our school is filled with eager children who are thirsty for knowledge.  As a group they are very hard working.  We have a wide range of economic diversity in our school. School becomes a ""leveled playing field"" where all students have an equal opportunity for advancement and growth. 

Students will be able to do a variety of activities with iPads.  I see students using them for research for their reports.  I imagine struggling students using the iPad for math drill and practice.  The advanced students can challenge themselves also with higher math concepts.  It can be used in a center when students have completed their assigned work.  The iPads can be used as a reward for students who complete tasks that they might not other wise find the motivation to complete.  I believe the possibilities are only limited by my imagination. 

Children in this age are surrounded by technology.  It is imperative that we teach students to become learners using this technology.

I take what I do seriously in my Law class. I am aware that when we talk about painful issues, it brings things up. We don't have enough text books-it is 2 or 3 kids to a book-forget having one to read at home- no funding for them in our strained inner city schools,  I have made packets for the kids and designed projects from the Internet and local library, and PowerPoints on laws and cases. We borrow movies from the city library, but it would be wonderful to have these 3 books for the class. We are going to look at death and dying, too much a part of their worlds, sadly. We will look at suicide. We have a student right now at a local mental hospital who has attempted to take her life twice this year already, and we also want to deal with being bullied and labeling people. City kids know all too well about being labeled. 

Your gift of these books will make a difference. You will open the door to reading practice and comprehension and they need that for college. We will read and discuss and have Socratic seminars like they do at higher level schools. We will learn vocabulary and apply words to new contexts. 

You have this amazing power to turn money into tools to help inner city kids. There is no feeling quite like it in this world when you see a kid open his eyes with the connections he just made or hear student relate how the class helped them adjust or cope or just plain understand. These books will open the door to talking and healing for these kids and I am building on their dreams of being part of the criminal justice system as lawyers and police officers and investigators.

Currently we only have a 24"" x 30"" markerboard that is ancient and barely works.  We need a new markerboard that is big enough for all of my students to see.   

I currently teach a third and fourth grade bridged 12:1:1 special education classroom. So there are only twelve students in my classroom and one paraprofessional to assist me with the varying needs of my students, from high functioning to very low functioning. The students are a very diverse group that come from many different cultures and battle with many different issues. Our school is located in a poor part of the city and we have a very limited budget as a result of the budget cuts made by the city.  

Our school lacks funds to provide the classrooms with even the essentials. I am a new teacher and thus I received all the leftover supplies and materials that teachers did not need or want. Thus, I was left with an ancient markerboard that is too small to see from the back of the classroom. I had to move all of the desks up close to the board and it is difficult to see the board from the one side of the room. I asked for a new markerboard at the beginning of the school year and I was told that I would have to make do because it is not in the budget.  

If you choose to donate to this project you will be helping students for years to come because the markerboard has a fifty year warranty. This new and larger markerboard will be useful to all of my students in my class because they will now be able to see the board. Please help us out!!"

Our school has started providing our own music for all of our dances. Many of our student organizations depend on these dances to raise funds for their activities. 

 

We have been able to cobble together a few speakers from our music ensembles, a few lights that we received from a previous DonorsChoose.org project, and we use my personal laptop. The students enjoy choosing music pumping up the crowds at the dances. They are aware that, while we are having a great time and providing a needed service to our school, we need better and more reliable equipment. My students want new equipment that can be used to make our set up even more professional!

A few summers ago, our auditorium's sound system suffered damages when our town and school had a flood. These new speakers can also help provide a boost to our sound system during concerts and theatrical events.  

By acting as a DJ for our school dances, my students are learning responsibility and commitment. They are learning the valuable lesson of community by helping their fellow student service groups earn money for trips, charity donations, and equipment. They are also learning how to plan and DJ their own events. This leads to developing important time-management skills and even earning some extra money.

Our music classes write and produce student-run theater productions. These speakers will give an added, and much needed boost to our damaged sound system.  

We need new equipment to help us DJ our school dances. We have a few speakers that we have borrowed from our band and chorus classes, but we are in desperate need of some quality DJ gear like a laptop, speakers, and lights to use at our school dances. We have decided to do this project in 3 steps: lights, sound, and music. This step focuses on sound.  

As student leaders, it is our responsibility to help set up for school dances, help select music to play, and encourage everyone there to dance and have a great time. We are also responsible for cleaning up all of our equipment and making sure that it is properly stored.  

We have an active music department. We look forward to working with our teachers to provide better sound for our performances. Since we began to provide music at own school dances, our school activities have been able to raise money for a wide variety of things. We have sent students to robotics competitions and helped to raise money for charities like Make-A-Wish. We hope to be able to continue providing a needed service, while also giving our classmates something fun to do on a Friday night!"

My students are tough, smart, resilient and hardworking.  They are eager to learn challenging science, and apply the principles to their lives and communities.  They are all from the inner city, and attend a school that has little in the way of resources, yet a tremendous amount of heart and dedication.   

All children are scientists at heart--we are born with an innate curiosity and an unquenchable desire to explore the world around us.  My students are no exception, and they look forward to the hands-on activities and lab experiments that we perform in class.  Real science is discovered through experimentation, and my students are hampered through the lack of a simple tool--a scientific calculator.  Learning to calculate pH, so we can measure the acidity or alkalinity of collected water samples, becomes an impossible task without a calculator which can perform a log function.  This is just one example of how a simple tool can have a profound effect on a student's educational experience.

My students will use their calculators as tools to explore the concepts of chemistry, derive formulas and perform statistical analysis on collected data.  They will be able to apply broad scientific concepts, and evaluate their conclusions with data, calculations and concrete measurements. 

Critical thinking skills and the ability to support scientific ideas with evidence is a cornerstone of an excellent education.  Developing those skills requires the use of simple tools, in this case, calculators.  A calculator is such a simple tool, we often take it for granted.  And yet, it is a critical tool in teaching students the importance of supporting scientific conclusions and ideas with data and evidence."

Students will use the two sets of energy books, along with Internet sources, to research different renewable energy sources, such as wind power, solar power, and hydropower. They will then use the hands-on materials to investigate tools for harnessing these types of energy. They will build K'Nex models that use these energy sources to operate, and compare and contrast the efficiency of each source. They will use the hydropower water wheel to experiment with hydropower and see first-hand how it can power everyday objects. This will prepare us for a field trip to see an actual water wheel in action at a local Iron Works.

My students will develop critical thinking skills as they evaluate each energy source. At the conclusion of the investigation, students will write an opinion piece about the renewable energy source that they have determined to be most efficient. 

The ability to actually build and experiment with objects that harness renewable energy sources will make such an important topic so much more meaningful for my students.

Our 5th grade students are hungry for expressing themselves through the visual arts.  They want to do more than learn about famous writers and illustrators, but have the opportunity to participate in their own creative expression. 

Our school is 3rd - 5th grades, with approximately 100 students per grade level.  The 5th grade class is divided into three classrooms; mine has 31 students. The fifth grade students this year are delightful! They enjoy helping each other, their teachers, and even the secretaries in the office. Due to the fact that our small city is quite isolated, it is important for our students to develop a sense of family at school.  There is a wide range of incomes of the families in our community as some rarely leave the area doing all their clothes and food shopping locally, while others are able to travel on family vacations to Disneyland or Hawaii.  Students at the fifth grade level become very social and aware of how they may be different from others. It is a perfect age to teach them how to accept others regardless of their differences. The students at our school are fortunate to live in an area that focuses on activities kids like such as sports' teams and 4-H. 

Due to the cutbacks in education in our state of California, supplies for subject areas such as art or music have become quite limited.  The possibility of having an art container with oil pastels and watercolors, so students may participate in a rewarding language arts and visual arts class project is exciting to me as a 5th grade teacher.  During this project, 5th grade students will learn about a famous author, Faith Ringgold, who is also an artist and quilt-maker.  Her story quilts are part of a permanent collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City.  This project focuses on Ringgold's, Tar Beach, a story of modern day freedom.  It combines storytelling and writing with the visual arts; creating quilt squares. 

This 100 square quilt tells a story of the 2012-2013 fifth grade students at our school.  It represents the diversity of the student body, yet collectively, a piece of artwork.  It provides students a way to express their creativity, while learning about aesthetic valuing; the appreciation of color, line, and design.  We hope to have an opportunity to share it with the community by hanging it for others to view. The art supplies will remain for future fifth grade students to also do the project."

These students are motivated to improve their science skills in any area. My school has a high graduation rate, and a high percentage of students who attend a 4-year college. However, we do not receive much federal funding for technology because of the high socio-economic level of the surrounding community in this small coastal area. The district is also limited in funds for technology. Thus, my school does not have the latest in scanners, and I do not have one available for my students. The students in this course are taking it in order to enhance and broaden their science education.

Helping my students perform forensics activities as a part of Chemistry II enables them to experience some of the skills needed in many areas of science. These are students who desire to be highly competitive once they graduate and go on to college. The forensics fingerprinting lab has multiple goals. Not only are the students engaged in learning about the biology of how fingerprints are unique and the chemistry of the process of fingerprinting, but they learn investigative skills as well as the steps in scientific procedure.

In the forensics fingerprinting lab, students take pictures of fingerprints and take actual fingerprints. They need to scan and enlarge the fingerprints, and they also need to print copies for their investigative journals. There are many long-lasting educational benefits to having the latest technology available. Students will be able to apply these skills in many areas of their education.

Your decision to support this project will make it possible for my students to not only complete the fingerprinting investigation, but to have technology skills that they can use in many ways. Additionally, with this piece of equipment in my classroom, students in other classes will have access to use it for different projects I assign."

""Move over so I can look!"" These are typical outbursts children make when they are all trying to observe something at the same time.  Kindergarten children are eager, excited little learners who want nothing more than to be actively involved in the learning process! 

My full day kindergarten class is an amazing group!  Our year started off with quite a surprise.  Due to a mold problem, our school was closed and we were relocated to the middle school for two months!  We spent Labor Day weekend taking down everything our rooms in the elementary school and setting up in a new location in the middle school.  We wanted our students to have an inviting place to learn, even if it wasn't ""home"".  The children handled this situation beautifully and when we moved back to our room in the elementary school, they adjusted immediately.  My class is an active group, but their energy stems from their eagerness to learn.  We are a small, rural school district in North Eastern PA.  Even though our district is financially strapped, we are very fortunate to have supportive families and fantastic administrators. There aren't too many teachers who can say that about their district! We truly are a school family! 

Document cameras enhance students' learning.  They make the classroom more interactive and create a stimulating environment.  They can be used in all subject areas.  When teaching reading, students can read along to a projected page on the big screen.  Interactive writing also works better with a document camera.  The teacher or another student can write while the others observe.  Math is a particularly excellent area to use a document camera.  Math manipulatives such as coins, counters, cubes, etc. can be placed on the camera face so the students can see and practice basic math facts, counting money, sorting, etc. Document cameras make whole class examination in science come to life.  By placing objects like caterpillars, rocks, flowers, etc. on the camera face, students can all see at once, preventing pushing and shoving when kids can't see.  As a kindergarten teacher, I am constantly demonstrating things to my students since they can not read yet.  Document cameras make this easier! 

Technology keeps a child's attention.  We teach a generation of children who have some sort of technology in their hands as often as possible.  Needless to say, if teachers aren't constantly ""entertaining"" their students in some way, they lose focus.   Young children need a variety of experiences to learn new skills.  Whether it is modeling ways to solve math problems, writing a story, or doing a science experiment, document cameras create more discussion and interaction in the classroom."

The speaker will allow my students to be able to hear the music and GoNoodle loud enough for all of them to feel the music and get active.

Our brain breaks include practicing our cheers for the school's pep rallies. The kids mentioned to me that whenever they are practicing, it is hard to hear the coaches or each other; therefore, I have requested a microphone. I incorporate movement as much as I can into my lessons because I understand it is difficult for a child to stay seated all day. Not only will these resources be used during our daily practices after school, but also during school projects and brain breaks to stay fit, active, healthy and motivated.

We are a Title 1 school, but no funding for tutors, reading help, gifted programs, etc. The students depend on the teacher for any and all education during the school day. The students are on free and reduced plans in the cafeteria, backpack programs for weekend food, and parents can sign up for parenting classes.  

With these tools, the students develop fine motor, pre-writing skills in a social setting. My students will learn through authentic experiences, share learning, and teach others by example. Using the tweezers helps to develop the pincer grip. The spring in the scissors helps the student focus on direction of the cut. The light pad helps the students discover in new ways while using fine motor tools. The latch, boards, and manipulation tools help the students use the pincer grip to learn life skills.  

The tools in this project will help many students for years to come. The students will have the opportunities to open and close solid and flexible items. This will lead to learning how to dress themselves, even if they have never had lace up shoes, lock boxes, etc. My students will gain experiences they will need for their future."

Many of our students' parents work odd hours and they barely get to spend time with their children. I have some students being raised by a single parent or a grandparent. No matter what my students are going through at home, they always try their personal best in the classroom. My students know how high my expectations are for each one of them! 

My students need an interactive whiteboard system to keep them engaged during daily lessons in the classroom.  Students love having the chance to use technology.  Why not let them use technology during daily instruction?  The interactive whiteboard will help students learn and participate in front of their peers.  They can help others learn while they learn!

With all that these kiddos go through, I do my best to give them a fun and exciting environment to learn in. 

I am hoping to get 4 Tag Reading Systems for my classroom.  Know what a Tag Reader is?  Well, if not, a Tag Reading System is an electronic pen that reads special Tag Reader books out loud to students.  How neat?!  You can even hook up headphones to the pen so that students can work quietly.  On each page of a Tag Reader book, students can touch the words of a story and they will hear them read out loud to them.  Also, there are literacy games on each page.  I was amazed when I got to try one of the Tag Readers myself, and have looked forward to adding them to my classroom for my students to benefit from.  All students will be engaged with these, my low level readers will get reinforcement from the words being read to them, and my on level kiddos will get reassurance of their reading skills from the spoken text.  Lastly, my English Language Learners will get valuable practice from the spoken text from the Tag Reader.

My eager, young scholars attend a relatively new school in a high-poverty area. My school administrators, fellow teachers, and I are working to ensure that our scholars receive the best education possible. We are determined not to let their zip codes determine their futures.

My students are mostly from a rural location. Many students at my school get free or reduced lunch. As a result, some may not have much access to advanced technology. This is the type of technology that could assist them in learning at a higher level. In addition, this is the type of technology that they may see in their future workplace, or at college. 

My students would be able to do real-world type speaking/listening activities if they had an iPad. They could use programs such as VoiceThread, and practice speaking the target language, record themselves, and hear correct Spanish pronunciation. They could also use apps, such as Duolingo, which are fun, interactive, and most importantly, educational. 

This project will help my students become more proficient in using Spanish. It will give them experiences with the target language that they may not get otherwise, unless they went to a foreign country. As a result of using programs from the iPad, students will gain confidence in their Spanish-speaking skills, and may be more apt to continue studying the language in the future."

Instead of just talking about leave no trace and sustainability, we want to get up and move to learn about our environment. These items will provide limitless options for teaching, and learning, while MOVING our BODIES.

With getting outdoors, comes the need for safety. Students, with my help, have develop safety plans and list of materials which would make our adventures more safe. When I asked them to rank their top picks on the safety list, they were especially excited by the idea of walkie talkies to communicate on the trail or on water. We have students with varying abilities, and it is essential that we are able to communicate to ensure safety in our group.

Reading is so essential that for young readers they need every opportunity to improve their reading. One way is through listening. Children listen to the people around them and learn to reading by hearing someone read to them.

With these six Jensen CD Bluetooth Boomboxes, my students will be able to group together and listen to various stories through audio discs. They will be able to match the words with the words they are hearing. If they do not understand what is being said, they can rewind and listen to the part they did not understand again. The CD players will also allow for students who miss a day to go back and listen to the part they missed.

The question is: What are we busy about?"" --Henry David Thoreau

This is the question that hangs at the forefront of my thoughts as I plan and implement assessment and instruction. I want my children to be busy with the business of learning. 

Currently the most enthusiastic of students, kindergarten cuties, fill my classroom. Our classroom family is composed of children from many different cultures and backgrounds. Some come with preschool experience and some do not. Some have significant family support and some families are working hard to meet today's challenges. 

I am an ESOL- and gifted-certified teacher serving both populations in my classroom, and I am constantly seeking new ways to provide quality, differentiated instruction that meets the needs of each child each day. I seek to empower my students to take control of their own learning. You may ask, ""How is this possible with five year olds?""--but not only is it possible, I believe it is a priority if we are to grow a generation of self-motivated, hard-working, creative problem solvers. I trust in my students and I trust in my ability to teach in such a way that at the end of the day, it is not about the teacher, it is about each individual student.

Learning is exciting, motivating, and fun, but one size does not fit all. It is essential that we have flexible individual educational plans for each child each day. The integration of engineering and technology not only makes this objective possible, it makes it probable. The motivation inherent with effective technology integration allows me to effectively meet the needs of each of my students each day, thus insuring a kindergarten community of learners and thinkers.  

The materials I am requesting are the Makedo engineering kit, a Lego construction kit, and solar car construction kits. Each resource aligns with our curriculum and supports STEM integration in the classroom... integrating science, technology, engineering, and math for my ""kinder-engineers."" These resources will move us toward a goal of creating a community of thinkers and problem solvers... solving open-ended problems multiple ways. It is not enough to be busy like the ants; we need to be busy with the business of learning. 

Once the foundation is laid, my classroom will resonate with the busy hum of working, engaged children. You will see children curled up under tables writing in journals, sitting side by side in nooks and corners reading and discussing books, using any available technology, and happily engaged in problem solving and in the business of creating their own learning. These materials allow opportunities to lay the foundation for becoming effective readers, writers and thinkers."

This year I am teaching a second/third grade combination class. I am really looking forward to the challenge of teaching a combo class. I know this year will be fabulous as I taught second grade this last year and will have many of the same students as third graders. We will be able to start the year off with a bang since so many of my students will already know what is expected of them. 

My students need four sets of Magic Tree House books, Scaredy Squirrel books, Elmer books, and plush doll book characters for literature and art lessons.  This year my students will be reading Magic Tree House books for science and social studies content.  I would like to add a  set of four books of the first 28 titles.  Having a set of four books would allow my students to read in book clubs.  The Elmer and Scaredy Squirrel books are about characters my students love. I want to provide them more stories about their favorite characters.  The plush dolls will be used for art lessons.  I teach students how to draw the main characters in some of their favorite books, like Pigeon and Elmer.  Having the plush character in front of them to use as a model will make their art experience more meaningful. 

By providing these books and reading props, my students will have access to a lot of popular literature.  To get kids to read and to enjoy reading, they need to have books at their hands."

This upcoming school year we are offering, for the first time a physical education class. This is an opportunity to engage students in challenging, profound learning experiences that integrate research-based teaching strategies with Latino culture and traditions outside of the classroom and in a physical setting. 

Physical activity is key for the health and happiness of students as many times our students do not get opportunities to be active throughout the day. 
 Our students are very engaged within our community through after school extra curricular activities, but students do not always have opportunities to participate in physical activity. This is something will help them health wise, but is integral to their personal happiness in and out of school. Our students are young and have the desire and energy to be active on a daily basis, providing physical education will give them that opportunity to be active throughout the day meeting the physical and emotional needs they have. 

All the equipment will help our students be physically active and work towards their personal fitness. Your donation is very important. Soccer and basketballs will help our students continue practicing sports they are familiar with but with other materials like volleyballs, frisbees and yoga mats students will be able to experience new forms of fitness. 
Physical fitness is key for health, but is a form of introducing skills students can use in and out of the classroom. 
This class will help student connect skill from the field to the classroom. The equipment provided will  help students also work on teamwork, communication and social skill all which are translatable to the classroom.

As a science teacher (NYC Teaching Fellow Alumni), I was so excited when my principal approached me to teach a Community Service elective class. I had already been knitting after school with a group of girls for 3 years.  We had created and sold items as a fundraiser for the school--but we had not yet used our skills to benefit our neighborhood community...

So, for the past 10 months, we've been knitting and crocheting items for women survivors of domestic violence. We've created shawls, bags, accessories, hats, scarves, phone cases and we gave our first set of donations out on Mother's Day (we are partnering with a non-profit organization called ""Sue Rock's Originals"" who works with a specific domestic violence shelter.) When we delivered our items--we learned that most needed were bags. Women are leaving their homes, with all that they can carry--often in plastic shopping bags--and we can help them by supplying beautiful bags to show them we are proud of the choices they are making. We support and care for them.

Now, if you're a knitter...you know how long it takes to knit a bag! And, it can go quickly if you knit with large needles...but then there are holes in the bag, your pencils fall out! So, we've decided that we want to line our quick knit bags with fabric, so that the belongings of the women are secure. We have already received 3 sewing machines from donations for donors choose.  It has enabled us to get more items to the domestic violence survivors.  Now, we want to improve our skills--maybe even possible starting sewing some clothing to donate to the shelter.

Now...I know you are saying, ""a sewing books won't help her students prepare for college."" But it will, and I'll give you four reasons:

1) community service allows the students to be more competitive on their college application.

2) helping others and getting involved in the community allows students to practice their social, leadership and commitment skills (all essential to succeeding in college).

3) personally, I hope that my students will increase their desire to go to college by interacting with others who either did or did not make that choice. The reality is that the community I work in has few college attendants--and even fewer graduates. I need to help my students prepare to FINISH college, not just start.

4) people who volunteer are happier than others (too many studies to count!)--and a happy student will be more likely to COME to school. First they come and finish High School...then college."

My kindergarten classroom starts and ends with movement and has a variety of needs. These products will allow my students to experience that is stated in the quote. 

We are a Title 1 school with a majority of our students coming from low socioeconomic environments. In a community such as ours, students face daily academic challenges. We have a population of around 900 students and 85 percent are on free/reduced lunch. Our school also contains many native Spanish speakers and a large number of refugees. Most of my students face academic as well as social challenges due to their backgrounds and home lives. I have the honor of working in a dual language setting with two groups of students. My students are all native Spanish speakers. My goal is to instill a love and constant desire for acquiring new knowledge in learning with each student. This can be facilitated by your support in helping them expand on new experiences and bringing fresh new ideas into the classroom, such as with flexible learning seating. These students can gain personal successes and increase their options for a learning style that can begin in kindergarten. 

Kindergarten students are always on the move. In my classroom, they currently only have options for structured seating. With the support of others, they can have an opportunity to be allowed to move freely around the classroom while reading and writing in journals on an alphabet carpet square. Not only will these carpet squares allow added comfort on tiled flooring but these early readers will have a visual of learning to recognize a variety of letters that are printed on each of the carpet squares. We can also take these carpet squares outside in our school courtyard during science lessons and have a place to sit when we are making observations and journal our scientific findings. While on our way to a flexible learning environment, we can also be supported by the use of soft seats that just like alphabet carpet squares allow students to sit comfortably at lowered tables. The chair cubes will allow additional flexible seating that I can use with small groups during guided reading. 

I feel confident that by providing these donations for a student-centered learning environment, filled with flexible learning seating will give my students a chance to thrive on an individual basis, to help them gain the knowledge and skills needed to become successful in their journey of how they learn. I believe with others support not only will my students' lives change but they will be provided with a new learning style that they can carry on and ease their way into other flexible spaces."

I teach 8th grade art students at the High School in our city. This is the first year that 8th graders are here in the High School, so this year has been a big adjustment for everyone. The students who are in my class have come from different area middle schools. At first, they were shy and timid, but now that the semester is coming to a close, we have become like a family. They are funny, talented, enthusiastic kids who are excited to be part of the High School. The type of work we have done are caricature, optical illusion, self-portraits, pastel portraits, clay figurines, printmaking, color theory projects, an art history project, and two point perspective. The students have approached each project with creativity, effort and craftsmanship. They are great kids who deserve the resources needed in my classroom to succeed. 

An ELMO TT-02RX 1.3-Megapixel Document Camera is not your former school teacher's old overhead projector by any means. This classroom tool makes it possible for teachers to present and enlarge images and documents to the class on the projector. In addition to this, it can serve to make drawing demonstrations an easy task, enlarging and projecting what I am drawing for them in real time, rather than having the students gather and crowd around me to see what I am doing. The projector also has the capability to record these demonstrations for future use. Also, the projector has a USB port for easy connection to my computer so that I may project PowerPoint presentations of our upcoming projects, as well as PowerPoint's about important artists and works of art in the history of art, not to mention make it possible for me to show relevant websites and other sources from the Internet.  
 

An ELMO projector is a tool that will enable me and my students to do many things. Students will easily view my demonstrations, as well as create their own presentations that can be projected for the entire class to view. The projector will also eliminate several problems with our current situation - including having to crowd the students around my PC monitor to view presentations on the computer. My students deserve better, and the ELMO will be a more appropriate and invaluable tool."

While the school was formerly among the lowest performing schools in the state, my students have worked hard for the past three years and raised both the school's state test scores and graduation rate. In the process they have shown a desire to learn and are very good at doing so.

In addition, my students are extremely tech-savvy. They have grown up in a world that is becoming more and more dominated by electronic devices that ""make our lives easier."" As a result, they have in many ways learned to interact with the world through them. In truth, they can do more with their cell phones than I can do with three other devices. It is truly amazing. 

This year I would like to bring my classes into the 21st Century. Ideally students will SKYPE with professional storytellers and artists, create short video presentations including commercials and PSAs, participate in interactive lessons using SMART technology, create a podcast, record themselves giving oral presentations, and create original digital drawings. We have a great deal of the technology needed to accomplish these tasks; however, without a functional laptop to facilitate it, most of it becomes useless. Our current laptop is very slow, has limited memory, and turns off when we attempt to play video. In short, it will not support the technology that I believe is vital for teaching this generation of students. 

Unfortunately, my district will only support very specific laptops that are very expensive, which makes it extremely difficult for teachers to replace their laptops on their own. 

For this reason, I am asking for your help in bringing my classroom and lessons into the 21st Century by donating to this worthwhile project. I have seen such growth in each cohort of students that I have taught over the past three years and I am certain that I can help the next grow even more by using technology intelligently in the classroom."

It has almost come to a point where if I don't get a chance to read them a story, they're disappointed, and insist that I read two books the next day.  

What they enjoy most is being able to look at the books when they are placed in the learning center. They like to act out the stories with their friends.  Sometimes they even try to pretend to be the teacher reading to other children. All they need is a wider selection of books to choose from to help them grasp ideas more concretely.

My 2nd grade enrichment students come to school every day eager to learn and to be a community with each other. They love technology and immerse themselves in the projects that we do. It is incredibly inspiring to see the glow of excitement on their faces when their tools include technology. They come to my classroom craving knowledge, new ideas, and opportunities to explore.


With Dash & Dot, my scholars will be able to learn the language of code. In conjunction with our classroom Kindle Fires, they will communicate with the robots to make them navigate through mazes, make them write or draw, make them dance, make them play music...make them do anything that their inquisitive minds can imagine!  
Donations to my project will help shape the future as scholars are exposed to cutting edge technology.
With Dash and Dot computer programmable robots, my scholars will be exposed to a level of computer science that they otherwise would not have access to. They will be the first group of scholars at my school and even in the entire school district to have access to a learning tool like this. Dash and Dot will give my scholars an advantage and will encourage them to pursue a career path they would have never imagined without the exposure with this innovative technology. 
I want my scholars to see that computers are actually machines that you can program to do what you want. Coding is an invaluable skill that our scholars need to become proficient, in order to be globally competitive in the future. By helping us purchase these robots, you will infuse a lot of wonder, creativity, and problem solving into our Enrichment classroom. 
By the end of this year, I want to have equipped my scholars with inspiration to become scientists, engineers, and thinkers. Having access to coding technology will help to level the playing field for my scholars. They will be confident learners -- ready to be competitive innovators and creative problem solvers!

At my school we are committed to providing our students with many diverse learning opportunities.  We stress the importance of not letting your environment dictate their success. 

The STEM learning labs that I am requesting will be used throughout the school year.  My plan is to create opportunities for the students to use multiple subject areas to create and design. I am also asking for a STEM project based activities that will allow the students to use their knowledge to take a real life problem and create a solution. The science journals that I am requesting will allow the students to keep track of all of their science experiments that we will complete throughout the year. 

This project will help my students to practice applying their knowledge.  They do very well with answer basic recall questions but struggle with high order thinking.  The STEM materials I am asking for will allow my students to practice handling situations which will require them to use higher order thinking skills."

Well, times have changed. For the first time in my schools' history and my many years teaching, my first grade students will not have desks beginning September 2010. 

They will not have places to put their pencils, erasers, crayons, or sharpeners. They will not have places to put their science notebooks, favorite books, poems, writing drafts, or math tools. My students will lose their desks over the summer and will have tables instead of desks. They need to keep their papers and other things together. As any successful student knows, you have to know where to put your things so you can find them. At this age, they are eager to learn and need the organizational structure in place to help teach them how to keep their things together. When the desks are taken away, how will they organize their materials? Where will they put their folders? Where will I store their folder holders? Where will they put their pencils and crayons? How will I be able to help them reach their academic potential and foster their independence? 

Each student will receive a holder for their many folders, and a place on the back of their chairs to put their pencils and crayons. Also, the class will have a bookcase for all the students' holders. With these structures in place, their routine will be clear from the first day of school. They will know where their papers, pencils, and crayons are. They will have a place for everything they need for a great beginning to the school year. When they're organized in the beginning, they can focus their attention better on learning.  Their important study habits and work skills in first grade will sustain them throughout the school year. 

Children form their work habits early. They need to start the first day of school learning where to put their things and how to organize and access them easily. These materials will help keep them focused on what is most important. Each child will learn the organizational skills to start with a clean work surface every single day. No more messy desks! Imagine! What a small gift you can give them to keep them to keep their things uncluttered!"

Reading instruction is the biggest block of instruction during the day. They need an assortment of engaging material to keep them focused. 

The resources I am requesting are a variety of reading games. All of the games will reinforce the skills taught during our reading block. The games include skills on:syllables, sight words, blending, and sounds. I know these games will keep my students motivated and engaged.

Listening to what my students have to say before I introduce the lesson and ask them to listen to me, is key to my classroom climate. 

My classroom is filled with many different faces. We have students from all walks of life in our building. We have many students who have great lives and many who do not. Regardless of life at home, they are like any other child, curious and although they try to hide it, are eager to learn. They have their good days, and their bad but all in all my students teach me just as much, if not more, than I teach them. 

In this day and age, technology is a vital necessity in helping our students be career and college ready. Without this tool, their training here in school is not adequate in helping them succeed. Technology within the classroom allows me as the teacher to incorporate all kinds of media to my students to help them engage in a far more advanced way than just through paper and a pen. With the aid of technology, I can introduce my students to a  new world of knowledge far greater than they ever imagined. 

By having a projector and document reader within my classroom, I can reach a far greater audience through visuals and media of all sorts. Being an English teacher, having visuals or being read to with the words projected on a screen, or listening to music to understand the concept of rhyme in poetry, analyzing a picture or demonstrating a lesson, will aid in helping my students become successful."

This burden usually falls back onto the classroom teacher. I, like many fellow educators, spend a great deal of my own money to fill this gap for my students. 

Most of my fifth grade students come from very low-income homes. In the past, students have shown up to school with very few supplies for the year. Our school has traditionally taken on this burden by using our classroom budgets to help out. However, with such a horrible budget forecast looming, it is highly likely that we will have no classroom money to spend. This leaves teachers to fend for ourselves and find creative ways to fill this need. 

I am asking for pens, pencils, erasers, scissors, spiral notebooks, and EXPO markers. These are all essential components of students' daily lives at school. Unfortunately, their parents are not always able to provide and/or restock these items for their children. Rather than stating what we'll be able to do WITH these items, it is more relevant to say what they cannot do WITHOUT these items. My students would not be able to write without pencils; they could not create without scissors; they could not keep science or math journals without spiral notebooks; they could not use white boards as tools for partnering to problem-solve in math. As you see, we are not asking for something above and beyond what other students may take for granted. We just need our gaps filled in so that my students' playing field is equal to that of other fifth graders where high poverty and need are not an issue. 

I feel that one thing we can help our students develop beyond their reading and math skills, is to develop a sense of self-worth. One way to do this is to let our students feel empowered and valued."

The challenge of most of our students is the lack of resources available in the home.  I feel it is essential to provide these materials to allow them to gain background knowledge of such important subjects as careers.   

The materials I am requesting are various costumes of different community helpers including a doctor, construction worker, lawyer, firefighter, police officer, etc.  It is role-play such as this that allows them to strive for greater goals both as students and as citizens of our community.

Each day, these 28 special packages from different walks of life converge in one classroom to learn and grow together. They come each day hungry to learn, eager to help, and brimming with questions about the world around them. 

The most unique thing about our school is that it's located on the border between a very affluent, and very low income area. I have students who come to school each day from nice neighborhoods, who are well-fed and nicely dressed; however, I also have kids who come to school from their homes in trailer parks or one bedroom apartments, whose families are struggling to provide for their basic needs. 

This provides incredible learning opportunities for our students. They learn to practice empathy, understanding, and compassion on a daily basis. I love knowing that our classroom is representative of the real world, and feel blessed to be be part of such a special and unique learning community.

After participating in the Colorado Writing Project this summer, I have been inspired to do everything in my power to help my students see themselves as life-long writers, not just as students who write.  I hope to move them beyond compliance and into a place of passion and authenticity with their writing.  

But, in order to engage my students in the difficult work that writers do, they need good models to look to for advice and inspiration.  Having a print-rich classroom filled with mentor texts will allow my students to access books that will help them in their journey to do and try what real writers do. 

I will use these mentor texts for my focus lessons with the whole class, but also look forward to having them out and easily accessible to students for use and inspiration during their independent writing time.  These books have been selected with specific purposes and teaching points in mind; each one will lend itself to teaching about a specific craft or risk they can take with their writing.  They will help my writers as they learn to develop their ideas, organization, structure, word choice, imagery and voice.  I also plan to use them anchor texts that we reference throughout the entire school year for both reading and writing purposes.

My overall goal for these books is to use them to inspire my students to become writers-confident and passionate writers who take their craft beyond the walls of our classroom to make a powerful difference in our world.

My students are reluctant readers. For many, reading is not a priority at home and their skills are lacking. They are not motivated to read, and feel that books are boring and not for them. Without practice reading, these students fall further behind in school and become discipline problems. When they arrive at our campus, they have become ""problem children"" and are often incredibly behind in reading.  

We have no library in our school, so we find ourselves trying to loan out personal books or directing students to the public library. Having a classroom library would make reading more accessible to our students. I am asking for popular, high interest, young adult fiction books to engage students in reading. Many of the books have been made into movies, and this will make reading more relevant to their lives. I have also selected books that show teens solving problems appropriately,that  depict  minorities positively, and that display individuals overcoming challenges that our students face. 

By reading outside of school, my students can reestablish themselves in the classroom. Getting the right book can hook a student on reading for life. This leads to better readers who are engaged in the classroom rather than in disruptions."

It is a loving, child-friendly environment that seeks to serve the whole family and better our community. 

There is a wide range of ability levels among our students. We use the laminating supplies and velcro to make visual aides that help our students stay organized and engaged, through picture schedules and communication cards. Lamination and velcro are the staples of a Structured Learning Class. Several books and games were selected which will be used to help build social skills. There are also several sensory items on the list. These will give our students the tactile, visual and auditory stimulation that they need.

Our students come from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Over 95% of the student body is eligible for free lunch and over 90% receive public assistance. These factors come together and place our children at a huge disadvantage, but we are committed to providing them with a rigorous academic and therapeutic program. The school’s ethnicity is as follows: 60% Hispanic, 30% African American, 8% Caucasian, and 2% Asian.

I have a self-contained classroom, which services students with specialized learning needs. During classroom lessons, my students learn the basics of Math, English, Science, and Social Studies. They only venture out of my classroom for their elective courses, so the majority of their studies are done in my room alone.

My students complete many of their classroom assignments on computers, including essays, poetry writing, math work, and PowerPoint projects. Due to financial cutbacks, I have not been able to get a request fulfilled for basic computer supplies including: printer ink cartridges, USB cables, and a power surge protector.  These supplies are needed for our computer station in order to keep our computers and printers up and running.

I want my students to stay focused on their academic assignments, and not have to worry about lack of resources. They use our computers every day, and have assigned ""computer time"" to focus on writing skills. They also use their computers for conducting research, reading online tutorials, typing skills, and free time.

Despite my students' various emotional, environmental, and educational challenges, many of my students plan to attend college or trade school when they graduate. It is vital that they feel comfortable working with computers, especially as they move on to higher education and the world of work. Thanks for viewing my proposal and considering my kids!"

They read these books throughout the week to build literacy and comprehension skills. 
However, due to the lack of books in my classroom library, the students sometimes have a difficult time finding the books that are on their reading levels. They also must choose a book that they use for homework each week. This means that every week each child is in possession of 6 books, that is 102 books out of my library every week. Because my classroom library is lacking many leveled and genre books, students are forced to read the same books over and over again throughout the year. I would love for my student to have a wide variety of books to choose from in order to build their literacy.

My students are scholars and musicians, in that order.
They learn to value the lessons they learn in this program and apply them to their performance and to their everyday lives. The one thing I like for my students to take pride in is their performance quality. We collectively learn to produce a sound through our instruments that is not only correct, but quality. It is near impossible to do this with lackluster mouthpieces. This program is in desperate need of some new mouthpieces for our alto saxophone players. It will be amazing to hear the difference in sound quality when the students are able to play their instruments using the proper mouthpieces. 

The saxophone players are a huge part of the overall sound that the band produces. While every instrument is important, the saxophones are a tricky system. If there is one part that isn't up to par with the rest of the instrument, the whole sound can be affected. Using these mouthpieces and learning to produce a quality sound with them, will allow my students to become musicians that take pride in the way they perform and sound.

This novel, the story of a young girl growing up in Alabama in the 1930's with her brother Jem and her father, Atticus Finch, one of the most beloved and admired characters in American Literature, is still a compelling and thought provoking tale that my 8th grade students are motivated to read. When I read this book as an 8th grader, it transformed my world view and changed me forever. 

I have 32 students in my class and after many years of use, I have 28 well-worn copies of this book. We read it in class and some students have to share. I really need a full set of books, so that every one has their own copy in class. 

In these difficult economic times, with budgets being cut every day, a new set of a ""classic"" novels is not high on the list of priorities.  I believe that studying the classics is absolutely necessary to prepare my students for High School and College. By having a new volume of this 40-year-old book, my students will be inspired and motivated in ways I can't even measure. 

In ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", Atticus tells Scout that in order to know someone you have to ""climb into his skin and walk around in it"". I urge you to climb into my students' skin and for a moment remember the joy of discovering a book that changed your life. Perhaps this book will change their lives, as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" changed mine."

My students come from a neighborhood characterized by gang violence, drug addiction, and poverty. Despite all of the problems in the neighborhood it is in transition for the better. Many young families and people just starting their professions are beginning to move in. I really enjoy teaching these kids and feel as if I am making a difference in their lives. 

I am a Nationally Board Certified teacher, the highest level of certification available for those in Education. I also have 14 years of teaching experience. Despite my love of teaching,my success record, and good evaluations I can not teach a quality art program without resources. My schools budget is focused on improving standardized test scores leaving visual art a very low priority. My students have shown a great love for any and all sculpture projects I have done in the past. 

I need wire, wire cutters, and wire shaping pliers for my students to experience a sculpture lesson using the medium of wire. They will take their inspiration for the creation of their work by examining famous sculptors work throughout history and their everyday life experiences. 

Won't you allow me to experience my students joy as they are afforded the opportunity to sculpt with metal wire. Please allow them to chant your praises as they experience an art lesson entitled ""through the wire""."

Your imagination had no limits and anything was possible. My students have been so excited about art this year, but they are dying to learn about clay. With a budget of $0, it is extremely hard to find a way to make that happen. 

My school is an urban elementary school serving 536 prekindergarten through fifth grade students. The percentage of students at poverty is 98%. My school has been considered At-Risk or Below Average for the last five years. With all of that being said, surprisingly, my school is an amazing place! The majority of teachers at my school have been giving everything they have to our school for the last three years. Positive changes are taking place, but we still need a lot of help from people that are able to give. 

Children love working with clay because there is no separation from them and their work. A long coil of clay can become a snake, then a bowl, then a fish. Working with clay encourages fine motor development. Children pound, pinch, roll, flatten, poke, tear, squeeze, coil, stretch, squash, twist, and bend clay into all sorts of shapes, and sizes. There is also evidence showing the therapeutic effects of working with clay. Like many other art forms, clay provides a mean for kids to express their thoughts and feelings in appropriate ways. While it is not okay to punch a friend when upset, it is okay to pound clay into whatever he or she may like. According to Art and Creative Development for Young Children by Robert Schirrmacher, by age five children have the confidence and ability to decide on what they want to create from clay. With clay, children are required to problem solve and come up with creative solutions to their own ideas.
 

I am so grateful for the donors support last year! It is truly amazing to hear a student retell their experience with clay. Working with clay is truly a memorable experience for any child, but especially children who have next to nothing."

First graders love to learn! My students are excited to open a new book, read, and then share what they learned. I love to see them choose reading during their free time. We have a literacy block that allows students to read independently, in a small group, and with a partner each day. We have awesome volunteers who come in to read with the students. Students each take a book home to practice each night. Not all students have reading resources at home, so it is imperative that we help put books in their hands. Half of the instruction and practice is with fiction books and half is with nonfiction books. At this point, our classroom library needs more nonfiction titles. I look forward to offering more informational books to the eager learners. It is a joy to see their love for reading and learning grow each day! 

All the requested books are informational books. The students will gain reading skills, as well as learn about animals, people, and more. The individual books will be used as take-home books to practice for homework. The books are leveled to meet the needs of students. The biographies are in groups of six and will be used with reading groups. The topics will make great reading practice and discussions of famous people. The biography readings will be connected to research on the computer, as well. I can't wait to hear all the great information the students learn from these books! 

These additions to our classroom library will benefit the students in our room, as well as other first grade classrooms we share books with. The students will have more access to nonfiction text. The leveled books will offer opportunities for students to read independently and continue their learning journey."

At our school, all 1000 of our students have the opportunity to come to the science lab to gain valuable hands-on experiences and enrich their passion for science with exciting experiments & demos. This position is completely dependent on grants and donations for supplies. 

Our school is a K-8 dual language school with a large variety of students. We have a population of over 47% socioeconomically disadvantaged and 22% of our students are English Language Learners. Our school is small with small class sizes and dedicated families, staff, and students. Our school prides itself on our family environment and our students reflect our values of positivity, leadership, self-discipline, and high personal expectations when they move on to the high school level. We often hear of our students being considerate, mature, and successful in their ventures after UCS. I enjoy teaching science at UCS because the students get excited about learning. They are always yearning for more information, more experiences, and exhibit an enthusiasm for scientific knowledge that makes me excited to come to work! 

These national science standards based demonstration materials & activity kits allow students to explore the concepts of the solar system, human body systems, cells & organisms, & simple machines. Each kit has models, photos, activity cards, & equipment, providing hands-on interactions. Students get a firsthand look at cells & organisms as they create cell models, view cell division, & observe osmosis in action. They will also build marshmallow catapults & their own pulley systems, simulate seasonal changes, calculate gravity on other planets, & create a phases of the moon slider. I will use the supplies in multiple grades with appropriate modifications. Working in stations maximizes my equipment & allows students to do multiple activities in one lesson. Demonstrations get the kids excited & allow me to show more sophisticated experiments that cannot be done on a large scale. I want to record my lessons & promote science lab on our website to earn more grant money and exposure. 

My number one goal is that students enter high school with an advanced level of scientific knowledge but more so, with an incredible enthusiasm, desire to ask questions, and the critical thinking skills to find solutions to those questions. This equipment will assist me in reaching that goal."

We come from a wide blend of socio-economic backgrounds but we all come together to form a cohesive and productive environment. While our staff is nothing but the best, tight budgets can keep us from providing the best resources to foster our young learners' needs.

My students are amazing young people and are poised to break through and exceed their goals, but they can use support to go even higher! They are great readers and are capable of putting forth explosive effort. My students come from all walks of life and we speak a combined 5 languages between my 25 students. We learn from each other every day and they deserve the best!

Research is showing that the traditional model of school with desks in rows and a teacher talking at students for long periods of time isn't very effective. Haven't we all sat in meetings in uncomfortable chairs getting talked at rather than talked to? Wouldn't we rather be off, focused on the work we know we'd like to get to? Students are same way!

Providing my students with a comfortable and positive environment will help them maintain a positive attachment to their learning.  My project asks for two convertible futons that will be used for all different reading tasks. The couches will comfortably fit 3 of my students. I'm also asking for 2 floor lamps and a ""medusa"" lamp to help provide light for student reading. Standard fluorescent lighting is fine for some students, but studies show that some students are able to work and focus better with less institutional lighting. Individualized learning where students take a large roll in how they want to experience their educational pathway is the key to student engagement. Choice is very important to students and it absolutely applies to finding a place in our room to engage in learning tasks.

So many of my students are learning their identity as readers.  Being able to access texts in a variety of ways is just another step toward students becoming the type of reader they want to be. 

My students are eager learners, many of whom are still learning English.  They are passionate about learning about the world around them and finding their place in it.  My classroom is a combination of second and third grade students whose reading and writing skills cover a broad range.  In addition to being dedicated learners, they are one of the sweetest and hilarious groups I've had the honor to work with in my teaching career. 

The listening center and read-alongs will have a dual purpose in the classroom.  Our school has a dedicated 30-minute block for students to practice different reading skills in small groups.  In these blocks, students will be able to access different leveled texts for practicing different reading strategies.  This is especially helpful for my students who are striving readers.  The other portion of time that students can access the listening center materials are during our reading block.  Students are to read for 30 minutes but my students just learning English are unable to sustain reading for that portion of time independently.  This listening center would allow them to access text in various ways for the entire learning time. 

These donations will especially impact my English language learners and their ability to access texts that are otherwise inaccessible. This will allow them to feel more freedom as readers as they explore content and text styles they might otherwise not be able to experience until they were more versed in the English language.  It will allow my students to build their identity as readers."

In our reading and math small groups, children can bounce on the Zuma Rocker Chairs as they are doing the important work of becoming kindergarten readers and mathematicians. So many of our little students ask to move and bounce during learning time and this gives them the freedom to get the motion they need while also taking part in the group. Moving while learning has been shown to improvement outcomes in early learning. The sensory input from moving will help students focus while they are learning.

Our school is a Ninth-Twelfth grade neighborhood public high school in a large urban Midwestern district.
All of our students are Latino, and all of them come from low income families. Like many schools, we have limited resources, with a very limited number of computers shared with the entire school. Our students have very little background knowledge in the area of computers, and the majority do not have Internet-connected computers at home. Despite these barriers, our students are enthusiastic learners who are excited about gaining computer literacy and basic programming skills.
Our district is one of the first in the nation to require ALL high school students to take a Computer Science course for graduation. We have been piloting this course for two years, and the students who have taken it have learned a great deal. Some have even gone on to pursue postsecondary study in Computer Science. In Computer Science class, we learn about programming as well as doing computer art projects. 

These 26 Chromebooks will be used in several ways. They would allow us to provide additional Exploring Computer Science classes, as well as AP Computer Science Principles. Many students have expressed a desire and have been unable to do so because of insufficient computer resources. It would allow us to use a laptop cart in science and math classes with probeware for data collection in science labs. This would allow our students to use tools used in post-secondary science as well as engaging them in student planned inquiry labs with advanced data collection and analysis. The Chromebooks will be used in humanities classes to access scholarly databases and do research projects.

More importantly, these Chromebooks will allow us to integrate technology skills into the core curriculum throughout the school. They will allow students to use these computers for art projects in each class, Empowering Students Through Art. One example is when we use computers to create animations using Scratch. 

Firstly, it will give more students the opportunity to learn in a computer science class. My students will have an opportunity to practice science with laboratory techniques requiring computers for data collection. My students will be able to create art in many subjects, including math and computer science. My students will be able to do computer modeling of complex phenomena using these Chromebooks. Ultimately, this will help our students succeed in postsecondary study and in life!"

Many of my students do not see their self-worth. I encourage by pushing them to be better than they realize.
 

I am blessed and challenged by the diversity of my student body.
Our district has the largest amount of sub-populations in the surrounding areas. I have students who struggle with dyslexia, students that do not speak English, students that have learning disabilities, and students that have above average intelligence. Technology evens the playing field so to speak.
 

Technology helps everyone get involved. My students will be able to use the interactive board and projector to manipulate web-based models. They will be able to illustrate important vocabulary, and create notes for other students. This puts the teaching in their hands, and therefore increases retention of material. It also allows students to learn from their peers. If a student can teach another student, then you know there is true comprehension. 

As we progress into the future, it's vital that my students are capable of using technology and understanding that science is everywhere.
I try to instill a love of learning and vision of the future. Once my students realize they are in control of the path they chose, my job then changes into a sideline coach and cheerleader."

Within the past five years funding has been drastically cut.  I love to use technology in my lessons.  We have computers that are 10-15 years old.  This makes using new programs difficult.  Sometimes it takes 20 minutes for the computers to turn on. 

My students are eager to learn and love to enhance their learning with the use of technology.  Computers in my classroom are also used to access students, encourage reading with AR program, research, and enhance learning.  Often times when my students are on the computer, it takes so long to start a program or they are kicked off because of little memory left on the computers.  Students get frustrated because the tasks take so much longer to complete.  Also when using updated programs sometimes we have difficulty with graphics loading because the computers are so out of date.  Our computer lab was taken away because of limited space in our building so my students have limited opportunities to use technology in school.  We currently have 4 desktop computers in our room that are 10-15 years old.  They have the huge box monitors and are running out of memory.   

Students would use the laptops to complete the STAR test to access their reading skills and so students could see their progress.  Students would also use the laptops to complete their AR test to participate in our classroom contest to enhance their independent reading.  Also we do Internet research to learn exciting new concepts.  The laptops would be used as a reward for completing their work. They can earn computer time to go on sites of their choice. 

With updated technology in our classroom, my students will be open to a world of opportunities to increase their learning experiences.  Most of my students do not have access to technology at home and our classroom is the only chance they have to explore with technology.  Please consider giving to my project and opening a world of possibilities for my students."

We are a Title I school, 91% free lunch, 86% second language learners and 100% awesome! I want to be able to match their enthusiasm; to present them with challenging, engaging ways to exceed the standards. 

Our classroom is a team. Our number one rule is everyone is included and no one EVER feels left out. Together we work hard so everyone is successful. Sometimes that means things get a bit chaotic, sometimes things get loud, sometimes it gets downright messy and other times we just dance. No matter what it looks like we are always challenging ourselves to learn more. In our classroom the students are responsible for running the class. We take attendance, fill out our own nurse pass, we make sure everything is turned in and checked off and we solve our own problems. Ms. Estis said we should be the ones working the hardest. She even made us write this!  

We learn best when we can actually DO what we are learning and not just write about it. When we were learning about measurement and perimeter Lucy Lego sent us a letter with a house she wanted built. We had to use our knowledge to make the house she wanted. It wasn't that easy. Our bin of Lego bricks is not very big so we couldn't all make our houses at the same time. When we learned about decimals and fractions we used Lego bricks to make models. Now we are researching historic figures to show how the past cultivates the present. One student was creative and made a model of a Frida Kahlo painting to go with her biography. Using Lego bricks makes learning more exciting. Ms. Estis got our Lego box at a garage sale. There are not a lot of people. With Lego bricks we could use them to illustrate our writing. We could use them when we learn about science to make marble runs. We could use Lego bricks to do almost ANYTHING!!   

Lego bricks increase student motivation immensely. Their ability to show mastery of learning targets and apply them in a variety of ways is impressive. Students are coming to me with ways they want to use Lego bricks to show their proficiency daily. A decent amount of Lego bricks would enable multiple students to have projects going at the same time. It would also allow for more collaboration. Using these simple bricks has turned some of the most distracted students into the most motivated."

They also need to be able to do so in a manner that allows them to take risks and self correct their work.  Individual dry erase boards and dry erase crayons will enable them to do so. 

I teach at an urban school in California with a very diverse student population.  There are four home languages in my classroom alone.  The majority of my students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. They are a very inquisitive and energetic group of kids and active engagement is key to their academic success.     

These dry erase boards and crayons will enable the students to immediately practice and apply a number of academic skills including phonics, spelling, writing conventions and numerous math concepts.  They will also be able to utilize them for creative purposes during art and free time.  If each student has their own dry erase board, they will get many more opportunities throughout the day to actively take part in lessons.  During some lessons students wait to be called upon to come to the board in front of the class or to provide an answer verbally.  Individual dry erase boards will allow all of the students to participate and share their answers much more frequently.  They will also allow me to make regular checks for understanding with the knowledge that individual student answers are less likely to be influenced by the work of others.   

A key factor in acquiring any new skill is the ability to take risks in applying the skill free from worry if it is being applied correctly or in knowing that immediate self correction is an option.  The students will be able to practice and learn in precisely this manner.  If a mistake is made, it can be quickly and easily corrected.  Students also become easily frustrated if they feel their voice is not being heard. Everybody will be given more opportunities to have their input acknowledged."

My students attend a high poverty school and have to overcome obstacles at home that children should never have to face. By creating a fun learning environment, students learn concepts and skills without facing the boring drill and kill of poorly equipped classrooms. 

These academic games are a great way for students to use their skills without feeling overworked or getting ""School Burn Out"" at an early age. By creating an engaging environment, teachers foster a love for school. This then creates students that become life long learners. 

Young children need learning opportunities that are masked as games and play!! Children learn best when participating in hands-on activities. These learning games and activities will convince my students that reading and learning is fun! Children ages 7-9 have a very difficult time focusing for extended periods. Your help will enable my students to learn much needed literacy skills in a fun environment."

My students have the opportunity to get help in math and become successful through a remediation program, but need extra supplies to make the program successful. 

Our school is composed of students from a rural community in Mississippi.  There are about 700 students at our school in grades kindergarten to eighth.  I remediate over 100 students from grades one through six.  These students struggle in math, reading, or both.  The students are very eager to learn and are excited about getting the help that they need. 

I am requesting HP printer ink in black and color so that I can print individual activity sheets for students.  The Internet is a wonderful resource, but without ink to print activities, it becomes of less value.  With the current budget crunch, printer ink is not a priority. The clear folders and Vis-A-Vis pens will also help me to conserve my resources.  I will be able to use activity sheets with more than one student because they can write on the folders and wipe them off for the next student.  This is especially helpful when doing programs such as mastering math facts which would require hundreds of copies a week.  Students can reuse facts sheets and conserve copies.  Instead of making one copy for each student, I can make a group copy of 10 and reuse it with each group.  Students will get the extra help they need and have the resources they need to become proficient in their grade.  They will receive differentiated instruction that will make them successful students. 

By donating to our class project, you will ensure that students who need a little extra help will get the individualized help they need.  You will be providing valuable resources that will give students the upper hand and hopefully empower them to become independent learners."

It even includes real world experiments where students design methods to build a bridge, perform a well rescue, and provide safety from a flash flood. These STEM projects will have my students working together to solve problems. They will be talking and thinking outside the box and experiencing higher order thinking as they learn science, technology, engineering, and math.

My students are inner city warriors of New York.  They are strong, resilient children, who, at times, are more adult than child because that is what life demands of them. They battle their surroundings everyday, and school is sometimes their only escape.  Now imagine that they come to school to learn, escape outside problems, and that school cannot provide technology in all of its classrooms, games for free time play, and interactive classrooms where the students can truly flourish.  They deserve the same opportunities that all students have because they are not just warriors, they are champions.

They love to create projects and learn new topics through a hands on approach to learning.  Young students are very creative and love to express themselves.  This is such an important area to develop in children and my students are always excited when music is incorporated into science, social studies, literature, art, and even math. 

Who doesn't enjoy listening to music while working?  With the addition of a CD player and music, my students will have an environment suited to creativity.  By playing classical music the students are calmer and more focused on tasks such as writing, math, and art.  There are fewer behavior issues when we are listening to music while working.  By creating an enjoyable setting my students will not only become smarter by staying focused, they will be happier too! 

Studies have shown a positive affect on student learning and behavior when music is played in the classroom.  I too have noticed a difference when we have quiet music playing in the background during working time.  Now that our classroom numbers have increased, we see more time being wasted on trying to keep students focused and on task.

Puppets break down barriers and provide an effective means to initiate communication. I wish for my students to enter and explore the fascinating, inventive world that puppets create. 

My school is located in a predominantly low-income neighborhood in Southern California, where the majority of students are English language learners. Puppets can be a powerful way of bringing language arts instruction and story time to life. Puppets can provide a focus for role play, encouraging the child's imagination and involvement in activities.   They can play a fundamental part in the recitation of stories and verse, fostering language development and communication. In addition, hand puppets with workable mouths and tongues are an excellent motivational resource to inspire the teaching of phonics within literacy. 

Any puppet can encourage the quietest of children to start talking. The child trusts the puppet and doesn't feel threatened by it, making it a perfect neutral medium through which they can discuss sensitive issues. The child can express thoughts, fears and feelings through the puppet that they might otherwise find difficult to voice to an adult.  

Using puppets in the classroom has shown me that they are perfect for grabbing wiggly, active kindergarten students' attention because they are fun, engaging, and a natural progression from cartoons and Disney movies they likely watch at home. The innate interactivity between puppet and audience draws children in and encourages them to be actively involved in the learning process, while sharing their thoughts and observations. 

I also teach grades K-6 during our monthly Saturday Arts Academy, and with the older students I can have them write out skits to perform with the puppets.  Writing for the puppet allows them to be far more silly, as well as take risks with accents, characters, and plots that they wouldn't try if they were required to act it out live.  Using a puppet transforms getting caught in the headlights into shining in the spotlight! Students share with less risk, and together the puppets create a performance, using collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creativity. 

Building good communication is key to all effective educational activities. Puppets change the classroom by inspiring creativity. They give students a voice and put them in the role of creator.  Puppets help everyone in the classroom to relate. This relational dimension is what I value most about using puppets in my classroom- breaking down barriers, building a strong, trusting link between myself and my students. This will enhance and impact their communication skills far into their future."

We are a public school with limited resources, not eligible for the extra funding available to poorer communities, yet not having the wealthy resources of some of our more affluent neighboring schools. I've noticed they are a group of gifted writers and I would like to encourage writing extensions from these books. They are good boys and girls, eager to respond to positive encouragement and instruction. I believe these materials will be effectively used in the classroom in developing socially responsible citizens. 

These books will be used to teach students social skills and responsibility. They will be available to students for independent reading, a great way to practice the skills that are taught during reading instruction.

The teacher will be able to introduce different lessons with the books to encourage appropriate social behaviors including such concepts as self-awareness, empathy, healthy behaviors, self-confidence and control, social cues, problem solving and how to employ calming strategies. The concepts taught in the books will introduce topics for further discussions and possible writing extensions or even art activities.

Students will learn the value of themselves as well as others around them. They will also be encouraged to practice some of the strategies introduced, or to consider how the characters were able to problem solve in the text read from.

My students vary from general education students, to children with autism, blindness, developmental delays and second language learners.  As their teacher, it is my job to make sure that I reach the needs of ALL of my students.  My school is  a high poverty public school.  I try to use as much technology in my class as possible, because what they see in class is all that they will get.  Most of my students do not have the luxuries of all of the different kinds of technology that is out there.  

In kindergarten, students receive the foundation for all future learning. However, with the broad range of students that I have in my class, it is sometimes difficult to reach all of them in every subject.  I like the idea of the Hot Dots, because a student can work individually or with another student and can listen to the information over and over again.   With the Hot Dots, they are able to self-correct and feel more independent.  I can use the Math Hot Dots as well as the Phonics Hot Dots.  I like the fact that they hear the sounds and things can be repeated over and over for them.  I do believe that with this extra help and hands-on activities, it will increase their growth. With extra Phonics and Math help, they will be able to get past their areas of difficulty and build upon what has been taught in the class.  Some kids need to do things over and over before they catch on and this is a great way to achieve my goals for them! 

I really believe that my students using Hot Dots will significantly increase their understanding of what I am teaching.  Many kids do not get the information on the first time it is taught, so the much needed reinforcement is detrimental to their understanding and achievement!"

This project will be to purchase two digital camcorders that are durable for 7th grade hands, but yet small enough to attach to the robotic vehicles they design. 
The students will be able to learn about remote robotics and points of view as they use the cameras with their robots. There are many careers that utilize robots with remote view capabilities and this will allow them to apply the skills they are learning in class with a real-world connection. 
Seeing the path the robot takes from a different angle will also help the students to fine-tune their designs and programming sequences.

Since the focus of the school is STEM, I want to infuse art into the mix through creative activities with my students. 
Art is an essential element for learning. Students need a place where they can express themselves creatively. 

By allowing students to express themselves artistically, it gives them a sense of accomplishment and self-worth that other school activities may not provide them. They will use the materials to create things they had only previously imagined. They will also learn skills that can translate into other parts of their academic day and everyday life. 
Art is an expression of yourself. Through art projects, students can apply concepts they have learned in other classes to a real world activity. It expands their minds and shows them that there are infinite possibilities as long as their mind is open.  They can apply math and science concepts to create a masterpiece.  
In the past school years, some of the students favorite projects have been making things out of Duck Tape. They like to make purses, wallets, key chains, and lanyards.

However, there are some students who are unable to physically access the school's standard swing set.

My Functional Life Skills classroom services a diverse student population. These students have a variety of functional and developmental needs. The motion of swinging allows students to physically calm themselves, something they would not be able to do on their own. Unlike other students mine are at the early stages of pre-academics as well as developing life skills one would need to function as independently as possible. 

Appropriately accessing playground equipment is essential to teaching my students not only playground norms, but social interactions and peer play. With the addition of an adaptive swing my students who are not able to physically access the standard playground swings would have an opportunity to swing along side their peers in a like activity; offering them the chance to form peer bonds and foster friendships.

Many of our students are wheelchair bound and require adaptive equipment for mobility. With an adaptive swing many of my students, would be able to access the playground to its fullest capacity for the first time. They would be allowed the experience of swinging beside their peers in a safe and enjoyable environment. Respected Physical Therapists have demonstrated that an increase in mobility shows a direct correlation to an increase in students' verbal capacity. For example, my students would be able to experience the wind in their face, a speed of movement they are not able to achieve on their feet, as well as a pendular motion that swings offer.

One cannot discount the peer interaction and socialization that occurs on our school's playgrounds. When a child is able to perform a similar activity as their peers, such as swinging, there are a variety of skills that are nourished.

The community where I teach is known to be a tight knit community with great parental support. My school has 544  students from Pre K through fifth grade. I am new to this school, but from what I have observed, I see technology is a priority to them. My students are energetic, lovable and eager to learn. Our school focuses on technology integration with the students daily. I am fortunate to work in a school that strives for technology resources in our classroom.Our Pre K-5th grade school is an elementary school. We have 535 students here. I am a 2nd grade teacher who has taught other grade levels in the past before settling in 2nd grade. The children truly embrace STEM Projects at our school. I am interested a bundles that will offer my students a chance to learn by discovery and engage the students with higher order thinking skills.  

STEM.. what is it? How can it help in my classroom? First, STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering & Math education. The focus on these areas are a melting pot for skills and knowledge in each discipline. Obviously, these fields are deeply intertwined in the real world and it has been proven that students learn most effectively when used for hands on projects. As a 2nd grade teacher, I am requesting one 2nd-3rd STEM Bundle kit. Not only would these units bring collaboration, problem solving & discovery, but it will offer a variety of creative ways for learning in my classroom. These STEM projects will have my students working together to solve the problems that are presented. Each will offer discussion and problem solving along the way. They will learn higher order thinking as they learn science & engineering objectives. We know science works on a trial & error basis, which in turn brings important & powerful discussions in the process. What a wonderful way to learn!  

What teacher doesn't love the words, exploration, discovery & the power of learning? The chosen STEM units and bundle I am requesting can bring forth the wonderful world of exploration, the intrigue of discovery and the power of learning. Add collaboration, creativity & higher order thinking skills to this equation & what do you have? Engaged & excited students who are learning! We are hoping for an engaging & fun STEM Bundle!

My classes are made up of students with Autism, Specific Learning Disability, Other Health Impairment, Hearing Impairment, and Speech or Language Impairment. Because my students struggle with academic achievement, they often have behavioral issues. 
In the past few years there has been a major cut to funding especially in the Special Education Department, including teacher positions as well as materials. Lack of funding for materials heavily impacts my students. Research shows that movement stimulates the frontal lobe which controls attention and focus. With the resources and space provided there is little opportunity for movement throughout the room within the class period.
The inability to focus or filter out the many sounds and noises heard throughout our environment, are just a few of the struggles faced by my students. Many of them have ADD and need opportunities to move. 

I am asking for 15 Exercise Balls with Legs to replace my plastic chairs. Sitting on a ball could be characterized as active sitting,  this continuous movement allows the body to make small adjustments. By targeting and stimulating the under active region of the brain that is responsible for the characteristics of inattention, the attention of students can be strengthened. The usual approach of removing all stimulation to improve attention is not an effective strategy. It is not that a students isn't paying attention; they are paying attention to everything. A child's attention develops when they are performing a task that requires attention while also being exposed to structured distracting stimuli. These exercise balls would serve as the structured distracting stimuli that would help improve their attention. 

Numerous studies have shown that replacing chairs with exercise balls not only increase student attention, but also improves academic achievement and standardized test scores.  By replacing my chairs with these exercise balls, my students will have the ability to continuously move while still engaging in the required activities."

My students are inquisitive and fun fourth graders. They are ready to be introduced to a new view of the world around them. They have grown up in the city, and there is so much in their neighborhood and state to explore. My goal is to excite them about the composition of the world surrounding them, so they will see their world with inquisitive eyes.

There are so many opportunities available on the iPads. I would like to have my students go on virtual field trips to places such as Plimouth Planation to see what the conditions are really like in Massachusetts. I would like the student to record themselves reading their own stories and make them into iMovies to share with other classes.

Who knows what scientists and future inventors will be in my class?

We need iPads with cases. With this technology, I am hoping to inspire my students to look at the world with new eyes and find new possibilities. I hope that they leave my classroom with an understanding of the world they live in and become adventurous and prepared to make the world a better place.

Please help these 9 year olds have a an amazing journey!,2013-09-07,Books,215.4,253.41,http://donorschoose.org/project/1063248,Grades 3-5,completed,2014-01-04,253.42000000000002,2013-09-11,No,Yes,"Do you remember being so excited to continue reading a book?  ""The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane"" has captivated my students throughout the years as a read-aloud that they beg for their own copies! 

Our school is a small public school with students from many different countries around the world, with varied life experiences. Being small is an advantage, in which all the students know each other well, work together and take care of each other.  Parents help in the classroom and the community spirit flourishes. Students share books with one another and discuss what they read in literature circles.  Some students have the means to have books at home and others go to the library to get their books. The classroom library, however small it is, is open for students to take books home or to keep in their desks to read when time allows. There are students in the class who haven't discovered how fun and engaging books can be. Books at their grade level are sometimes a daunting task to read while books at lower grade levels don't provide enough detail to keep them engaged. They tend to gravitate to easier books because of the large print and simplistic vocabulary but soon they become bored. 

I am asking for a class set of books that the students can read together as a class and discuss all together.  I am also asking for the book on tape so that they can listen to it at times. This story is highly engaging and is filled with things to discuss. This book will be the first book that many of my students will discuss in small groups and read together.  I want my students to be able to have a book to read at night and fall asleep with as I used to as a young student. I want to instill a love of reading and empower them with new vocabulary and new ideas and new connections that reading novels provides. Please help me help them!
My students really love reading! When we all read the same books, we support each other and share what different connections and ideas we take from each story. Knowing that a classmate is reading the same book will push all the students to read each night and allow for discussions the next day. I am excited to get this going and we need your help! 

One book can be read by a countless number of students!!!  This is a gift that will last for years to come and hundreds of students will take part in this adventure together!!!  This story of love will be remembered and could instill a love of reading for a child!  I am asking for a class set of ""The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane"" as well as the book on CD to allow us to listen to someone else read.  Please take part in this journey with us for when you help us we will take you along!"
e6f82321dcc8e760b9cb8afc31f663cf,My students need 15 dictionaries to help them discover new words that will strengthen their academic language.  Dictionaries are essential in learning a new language.,2013-04-14,Supplies,361.12,424.85,http://donorschoose.org/project/982463,Grades 9-12,expired,2013-08-13,167.31,NA,No,No,"""It always seems impossible until it's done,"" said Nelson Mandela.  

This is exactly what I am trying to teach my students.  Most of my them do not know how to look up words including the English language learners who comprise 41% in our school.  Dictionaries are indispensable for my students to strengthen their academic language. 

We are an inner city school with 41% of the students who are English learners, 80% are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  As a Title 1 school, it is very hard to teach students academic vocabulary, and have them rely on just what teachers explain.  Besides all of the social, emotional and academic challenges, our students are very intelligent, inspired, and success-driven individuals with unique personalities. They have, however,  limited available resources, but they also have dedicated teachers and staff who are doing the impossible to teach the students, and give the inspiring experiences to prepare them for college, and other expectations they will encounter throughout their lives.  As for my class, my students are very positive, and eager to learn French, the only other option they have beside Spanish as foreign languages.  In class, we have a few beat up textbooks provided by our district,  so students rely only on what we as teachers provide. 

We want our students to have access to resources that other students have at other schools nearby. With our high level of English language learners, it is very important for me to give my students the experience of learning new words from a dictionary. They will be able to determine word classification, context, synonyms, antonyms, gender, and many other grammatical functions. With the dictionaries requested, I will be able to organize competitions, games from which students will learn how to look up words, explain and use them by context, and facilitate student interaction through academic language.  In my classroom, resources are so limited that sometimes answers to word-meaning questions have to be delayed because we do not have academic resources to provide accurate answers. 

Our school goal is to improve the graduation rate, and use academic language.  Our school is working hard to fight these numbers and improve students' acquisition of academic skills. Today, you can make an immediate difference in the lives of students by giving them the opportunity to learn how to look for words, study the meaning of words in context, and help them use acquired knowledge through academic language. We thank you in advance for your kind support."

Do you remember the last time you did?  The Perks of Being a Wallflower is certain to be one of those books for my students. 

My senior English class is made up of a great variety of kids.  They come from diverse countries, cultures, with varying levels of English proficiency.  Most live well below the poverty level.  What they all have in common, though, is that they are about to transition from adolescence to adulthood, and let's face it, that's a daunting time.   

The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a young adult novel about a high school boy trying to navigate the social scene, make friends, and sort out both his past and his future.  Imagine Holden Caulfield in our modern world.  ""Perks"" is often called The Catcher in the Rye for a new generation, but it touches on topics more relevant to teenagers today.  In fact, my students will be able to choose whether to read Salinger's classic novel, or The Perks of Being a Wallflower.  They will meet in separate ""Book Clubs"" to discuss their book, and will later share their ideas as a whole class, making comparisons with the other novel.  The students who choose Catcher in the Rye will see that Holden's story is timeless, while those who choose Perks of Being a Wallflower will understand that the trials of adolescence are not new ones. 

This project is important for several reasons.  Students will have some choice in what they read.  They will have this high-interest, contemporary novel to enjoy and relate to.  They will use high-order thinking to draw comparisons to another work of fiction, and to their own lives.  They will take ownership of their learning and foster civil discourse in their discussions of the book.  For these and many more reasons, Perks would be a huge asset to my class."

Every day my students read for 45 minutes. This requires immense focus and stamina. They are doing a spectacular job, but new books will help them maintain their efforts. Every single one of my students has made over 0.7 years of reading growth in just five months. We want to keep this momentum going!

There are a variety of personalities and differing intelligences in this group. They are visually artistic, creative, innovative, exploratory, and adventurous. I am working on taking all of their qualities to develop lifelong readers and writers. 

Our students live in an urban community. So most of them have experienced tragic incidents non- existent to students their age from other regions.  Our classes serve students with a range of disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, emotional disturbance, autism spectrum disorder and specific learning disabilities. The typical student in my class reads at below or far- below grade level and many struggle with basic phonics and reading comprehension. 100% of these students are African American or Latino. The opportunity and achievement gaps are apparent among our student population. Although faced with many adversities, these students come daily eager to learn something new.

The donations from this project will make a difference with my students' learning because the materials will help address the needs of students with differing learning abilities. Meeting the needs of these students will allow me to bridge the achievement gap. The Common Core Learning Center Activities will provide them with quality and rigorous tools to help them collaborate with their peers to become problem solvers. The camera and photo printer will be used to capture those in and out of class moments to place in our school's newsletter. The timers will be used to develop their reading fluency and to pace instruction.
It will improve students lives by decreasing the number of the nation's functional illiterate population. This will allow America to be great again. Improving students reading ability allows them to compete globally with other students across the world. These academic materials will improve and increase student attention and focus, that will ultimately help to increase our scholars' academic achievement.

Our classroom is about growth. Not only do we get a lot taller in first grade, but our minds grow also.
The students in my classroom benefit from positive relationships between the adults in the school and other children.
Oftentimes, they have struggles at home, related to poverty, that would typically interfere with their learning. At our school, we provide what every child needs: a respectful, responsible and safe environment. 

The world of math is much more than solving equations. The requested books will support math instruction through engagement and real world examples of how math is used every day. Our classroom loves to sit and soak up books, so using a read aloud before math instruction will help their bodies settle in and get ready for learning.  

Best practices in education are to bridge subjects into an integrated learning structure. The requested books will help students make connections with the purpose of math instead of just seeing it as equations. Also, the group will be able to discuss the math in the book to deepen their understanding."

But like every middle school student, they could use some incentive and reward to help motivate continued focus every day in the classroom. 

Our school is on the far south side of Chicago. The school has high expectations for every scholar to learn during every day and reach their greatest potential. The scholars are hard working and have grown academically since last year. At the end of each academic quarter, the scholars have the opportunity to participate in a merit auction. This reward would be a great addition to the incentives that the scholars look forward to earning for their hard work in the classroom.  

The five scholars who earn their reward to go see the Bulls play would get several perks with this request. They would be able to ride together in a rental van to the game downtown. Then at the game scholars would enjoy the game and snacks before returning home. Many scholars at our school have an interest in the game of basketball. They enjoy playing basketball during recess and after-school. Some of the students I've talked to have sports role models and are fans of the Chicago Bulls.  

The scholars are not in the closest proximity to their favorite basketball team, the Chicago Bulls. This would be a huge reward to earn a trip to see the Bulls play. Scholars would find tremendous motivation in a chance to go to the game and thus this reward would increase scholars' desire to show school-wide core values of tenacity, empathy, to ask questions and make a difference."

As a teacher, it can be a challenge to keep lessons and activities as engaging as video games and the television. I am hoping the resources we are requesting will help solve that problem. 

My students will have the ability to work on critical reading and vocabulary skills while still enjoying themselves. This sounds perfect for my active learners! Students can brush up on reading skills with the reading comprehension game boards, work on word structures with the vocabulary builders, and use the buckets of manipulatives to problem solve during math. 

These resources will not be restricted to my classroom. Our entire grade level will have access to all of the materials. Each resource will work especially well during RTI or LEAPS.

I am continuously amazed at how mature and insightful third graders can be.  I teach in Spanish in the morning and English in the afternoon and my student population is a mix of native Spanish speakers and native English speakers.  Language and culture fascinate my students and they are constantly asking for more history books.   

The history that I learned years ago in elementary school and the history that is told today are very different.  My goal is to create a library of quality literature written by and centered around Native Americans.  All of the books on my list have been certified as quality literature by multiple Native American colleagues.  I am also asking for a classroom iPad to help us complete our year-long project.  This project stemmed from the fact that there were only two books about the Ho-Chunk that were deemed quality literature. I am currently in contact with Ho-Chunk elders to bring them into my classroom so they can tell us stories about their culture and life.  Then, using the help of our Pad, we will record their oral story, transcribe it, translate it into Spanish, illustrate it, and hopefully publish it.  

This project will change my student's perspective on who Native Americans are.  Part of this project involves diving deep into issues of stereotyping and negative imaging of Native Americans in our current media.  Numerous parents have already told me about the deep conversations they were having with their kids at home. Students will also get a closer look at the art of storytelling.

I plan to use this garden bed in our school garden on school grounds.  Students will be involved in all aspects of planting: they will put growing medium in the bed, plant seeds, fertilize, water, weed, transplant, and care for all plants.  They will be learning about the life cycle of plants and about the various flowers, herbs, and vegetables they will be growing, and will hopefully get to taste the fruits of their labor!  
     
These activities will assist with my students' fine motor skills, social skills, and teach them valuable life skills that they will use for years to come.  These skills can help them become independent, boost their self-esteem, and help with employment options in their future.

Sometimes students love it and sometimes they don't. Statistically speaking, most of the time they completely abhor the writing process.  

At our schools, kids come from variety backgrounds, more than 70% are qualified as economically disadvantaged. Students from impoverished families do not have the background (schema) or rich language that  middle or upper class students possess. For this reason, teaching writing is a challenge for all grade levels. Students need diverse language and experience to write well. Despite learning hardships, students may cry at dismissal time because they really need the structure and safe environment that school provides in their life. 

To engage students in the writing process, I would offer smencils and clipboards.  Kids would be excited to use the Smencils  and clipboards to write wonderful stories that can be a reflection of their own experiences or their imagination.  

Bringing a bit of fun with smelly pencils adds an additional sensory experience for students to harness their creative energy.  Smencils motivate students to write while the clipboards give them freedom to move around the classroom to become inspired and become better authors.  Students enjoy writing on the floor, outside, near a window, or even in their favorite reading nook.  The ability to move around and partner with other students is a great motivator for students to do their best work, share ideas, and help each other through the writing process.

Students of a variety grade levels will benefit from this project, especially our 4th grade students who will take a State Assessment in the Spring where they show their writing skills in English and Spanish.

The sixth, seventh and eighth grade math areas are critical as the students prepare for high school, college or trade school. 

The students are curious, motivated and anxious to compete with their engineering challenges. The students could be the first in their families to attend college and our field trip is to a local college where the students will enter engineering competitions. So attending the competitions would afford them the opportunity to visit a university and interact with engineers.

Our goal is for the students to visualize a college path. Research has shown fewer females and minorities go into STEM professions. In addition, due to the performance gap identified by the NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) in reading and math, minorities are less likely to graduate. This project includes: Hands-on math, science and engineering competitions.


The after school STEM Club’s project, Help the Students Become Apprentice Engineers, will utilize math, engineering and science concepts with real problem solving challenges for engineering competitions, hosted at local universities providing low income students to explore engineering and learn about college and career interests.

A sample engineering activity would be creating a COZIE, using recyclable materials. The students would collaborate, create the design and test. For testing the Cozie would sit in the sun for 5 minutes and compare the weight in grams of the ice cube after the 5 minutes to the measurement before testing. The students would choose team members and a challenge to work on weekly, for engineering competitions, regional and state.

The students will use engineering logs, photographs and illustrations to document their work. Through this design process, teachers should see an improvement in critical thinking, across the curriculum.

This Donors Choose grant will allow the teams of “Apprentice Engineers” an opportunity to compete with their challenge design against other teams across the region and across the state. The grant would pay for the teams’ registration costs and transportation to the regional event. These students would become apprentice engineers facing real world challenges!

We are part of a Title 1 school with a large free lunch population.  At this time,  we are currently building a new STEM curriculum for the fall and are excited to be a moving into a new school next year where our main focus will be to implement STEM throughout our day. 

As we implement our new curriculum, the students will be working in many iSTEM stations.  This is a perfect time to work with apps to create presentations to share what they have learned! iPods would be a great way to help us continue our learning.  We can use the iPods and create QR codes for sharing, listening centers, or use FaceTime to connect with others. 

My hope for this project is to allow my students to share their successes with others.  To help them build their confidence and to see that technology can be used for much more than gaming."

Thank you for considering donating to our project! We work in a co-taught middle school math classroom and work primarily with students who have IEPs. 
Our school has a large population of students who live below the poverty line and unfortunately do not have a lot of opportunities to work with technology. Each of our three classes have approximately 35 students in them, all with varying abilities. This year we would love to implement the use of clickers in our classroom for quick checks to see who needs extra help. We have the luxury of being able to pull small groups for extra instruction and clickers will allow us to see who needs the extra support to succeed! 

Thanks!
Mrs. Prins and Mrs. Heuser

Mrs. Heuser and myself are incredibly lucky to be in a co-teaching classroom, however, with 35 students it is still difficult to know that all of our students' needs are being met. Enter CLICKERS!

We have both observed other classrooms that have implemented a clicker system as a way to gain quick, formative information about students' levels of understanding. We intend to use them daily in the form of a quick check or exit ticket. We would come  up with a few questions relevant to the lesson we just taught, have the students answer, and immediately be able to pinpoint a student who was not successful in mastering the concept. This way we can use that knowledge to either revisit a topic or pull small groups to ensure that the needs of all of our students are met! 

The clickers would not only just be a useful tool for us as teachers. Students love love LOVE using technology in classrooms. Unfortunately we are in a district that does not allow for a lot of opportunities for new technologies, so this would be something the students can look forward to using.

Please consider donating to this project to better our classroom experience, improve our understanding of our students' needs, and to make math class fun for our kids!

My students are very dedicated to making music despite the challenges of the inner city. My students work hard every day to better themselves and the community through making music. The program consists of over 140 students and many come from very low income homes.

While the students come from an area with very little, their academics and test scores are rising at an incredible rate. This has created an overall feeling of excellence that has seeped into all aspects of the school, including this band. My students are very dedicated to proving achievement doesn't have to be tied to location. 

School bands exist for many reasons, but one of the most basic is to entertain.  My students love to entertain the fans at our basketball and football games by playing the most up to date music possible.  With these new songs we can keep our fans entertained but more importantly, we can challenge our students to learn something new.  

While our music department budget remains at $0, the enrollment keeps growing as students become more and more involved in music. We work diligently to raise money through working with community groups but still struggle to support the cost of a program this large. While it becomes more difficult to get supplies for these students, they remind me why the work is worth it everyday with their passion and dedication."

My students are an energetic bunch who want to learn everything they can in every possible way. My school is the only Non-Title I school in our district, which means we get less funding and help than any other school in district. Budgets are stretched and materials are just not available. Families were hit hard by the housing bubble and many parents do not have good paying jobs. Parents are often unable to provide extras for their children and many students are receiving free or reduced-price lunch. By not qualifying for Title I funding, we don't get much and every little bit helps. 

Centers are a big part of our day, and I would love to provide a safe, healthy and inviting classroom for my students. We learn best when we are engaged and having fun!

This kid inspired project is for wobble stools, outdoor recess activities and books to learn about healthy lifestyles. My students know they need to move all day in order to stay healthy and engaged in activities. They want a way to be able to move while also being at our small group table.  Wobble chairs are the answer to this problem. 
My 1st graders wanted wobble stools to be better engaged during groups. They have such a hard time sitting still while we are at our group table. My students will not only be able to wiggle and wobble at group but they will be able to read books about healthy living. 
They will also be able to get outside and play with the new sports equipment.
 Please help me provide a healthy seating alternative by supporting this kid-inspired project.

If you were to enter my room at any given moment it wouldn't take long to hear the sound of laughter. 43 students with varying backgrounds, interests, hobbies and learning levels. Yet they learn together, they help one another, they look out for one another. They are flat out good kids. Everyday I see one of my students do something that reminds me of who I want to be. I want the best for these young people. Seeing the excitement and the impact on learning that the document camera had on my high school students only lit a fire within me to find a way to provide this essential learning tool for them. These are the kids that say, ""thank you"" when I hand them test. Or smile ear to ear while handing a quiz out. They are great kids who deserve great things. 

Have you ever been surrounded by a group of individuals who are not only captivated but intrigued as well? If not, borrow a friends document camera for a day, download grade cam on your computer and give your students immediate feedback on their test. Better yet, let them do it themselves! Their eyes were huge as they marveled. Its not everyday that one is able to get a high school student to marvel. The moment the last student scanned his test there was an electricity in the air as I posted statistics per problem on the board for all the students to see. We celebrated together and vented frustrations together. We became one in our learning that day. These bright, self motivated young people then took it upon themselves to set their own learning goal. They then set out a plan and asked me to review a few of the concepts the next day so that they could be retested and prove their learning potential to themselves. What an inspiring group of young people. 

This document camera could just project or it could change the learning experience for every student. Combined with an on line grading program I would be able to provide my students with immediate feedback. I would be able to differentiate my curriculum and make extensions to topics on an as needed basis based on the results. Stop in the middle of you instruction and take a quick assessment. Then use the results to shape the rest of your instruction, or modify the next days instruction."

This is the year my students set goals for themselves and reach them. This is the year my students embrace academics and excel. This is the year lives are changed and dreams are achieved. These are the things we strive for daily in my classroom, and I am excited about this year! 

I have the privilege of teaching a career tech program, which means my students choose to be in my classes. They are truly interested in the medical field and pursuing both an education and a career after high school. While some students are more motivated than others, they are all driven in their own ways. We come from a rather poor county, but that doesn't stop them from setting goals and working towards them. They don't use their background as an excuse, but instead as motivation. I am so beyond proud of them and want to do all that I can to give them the best education possible so that they are prepared for the real world when they leave my classroom. 

I am requesting a class set of the book Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story for my students to be able to read and learn from. Reading and writing are fundamental skills that we all need, and it is one of the weakest areas for our students today. Through this project students will learn about Ben Carson through reading passages, completing written assignments, and taking quizzes. These books will not only help them improve their literacy skills, but it will also motivate them to never give up. Dr. Ben Carson is an incredible example of determination, hard work, loyalty, drive, and having a passion for making a difference in people's lives. He set goals for himself and didn't compromise who he was to reach those goals. Students need to see that making dreams become a reality is doable, and what better way than to ready about a real life hero who just happens to be running for President at this very moment? 

I truly believe students need real heroes to look up to today, someone who has been in their shoes and overcome hardships along the way. My students know what failure looks like. Many of them see it every day in their home lives. I want them to know they don't have to fall into that category. They can make something of their lives, and they can make a difference. Hopefully through reading about Dr. Carson they will find the encouragement and motivation needed to help them persevere and succeed."

Being a school that is economically diverse, some students are able to purchase their own school supplies, while others are not.  So as to lessen the anxiety in some of my students, I would like to start off the school year providing each one with a writer's notebook. 

I am trying to revamp the entire way I teach writing so as to provide more authentic writing experiences.  So many of my students declare they ""suck at writing"" but I firmly believe they are too young to know whether they suck at it or not.  And writing is something that someone CAN improve in...with regular PRACTICE and feedback!  

I envision my class being a workshop for writing apprentices, and having one portable place writers can keep their thoughts and ideas is crucial.  We will probably go through multiple notebooks in a year, but I would like to start off with just one. 

Writing is often called the ""Neglected 'R'"" and students simply need to do more of it!  These writer's notebooks will help in this quest to turn my reluctant writers into more confident ones who can access their voice and express their thoughts.  I believe in the power of the notebook!"

Using games in the classroom helps their language and academic skills at the same time.  I provide love, affection, and sometimes clothing and shoes to my students who are the most needy. 

My students need instant learning centers in order to become more engaged in their learning.  After using one of these in my class, I can tell a difference in learning! Instant learning centers are interactive, engaging, and challenging at the same time.  There are many different levels of students working on the same game, so when a child needs help, others within the center provide it.  These games are colorful and make meeting academic needs fun.  Many times a student will request to do one of them when given a choice. 

I currently have two literacy instant learning centers in my classroom and they are fantastic.  It challenges them enough so that I am not certain if some students can complete it, but with peer help and a little guidance, they begin to flourish in those skills.  I think that adding science and math will enhance the learning in those skills as well."

Not only do they not get to listen, they don't get that comforting feeling of reading with someone you love. 

I am asking for leveled readers with CDs, which are books at their reading level and each title has multiple copies, and a listening center with headphones where my students can go as a group and listen to the same story. Then, they have a partner to discuss the book with so that they can deepen their understanding. I am also asking for single student readers with CDs that they can choose to listen to more for enjoyment. 

With these materials, students will have many different types of books to listen to every day. They can read and listen alone to a story or choose to listen to the same story with a group. This allows students to hear and see unknown words more often.

This also will be a great motivator. I have found that many students prefer to listen to a story before they try it themselves out of a lack of confidence. This will help ELL students as well, who so desperately need to hear a native English speaker read.

Six HUNDRED students come through my classroom EVERY WEEK. I have eight tables from the 1980's that they sit at, and it's here where the magic happens! My students love art class, and I am fortunate to have a job that I love so much. I honestly feel like a rock star at my school! I get to make art with children every day which pretty much makes it the coolest job on earth. And because I love them and my job so much, I want the best for them. The eight tables I mentioned before? These tables are on upside-down ""T"" legs, and they are so old that the screws are stripped and rusted. I am no longer able to adjust the tables to stop squeaking and moving. And because the tables aren't on FOUR legs, there is no way to adjust the rocking of the tables. I am so tired of diffusing arguments where one student gets mad at the other because they caused the table top to tilt. And, honestly, the squeaking of the constantly tilting table top is driving me batty. Please help! 

There is zero money in the budget for art supplies much less furniture.  But new tables - ones that aren't 20 years old, squeaky and rickety - would be so appreciated by all 600 of my students! I love that the legs are adjustable and that the table top is unable to rock and tilt. I think they will make the biggest difference in my art class. I know I'll be thrilled not to hear the constant squeaking and arguing! 

The tables I have picked out through Donors Choose have FOUR adjustable legs. They are not the most expensive or the fanciest, but they look solid. I need supplies constantly. Without art supplies I don't have much of an art program. But the tables are the foundation of where and how we work in my classroom. They are desperately needed!

A voice amplification system, or a microphone in the classroom can help raise student achievement, increase students' attention, decrease teachers' voice strain, and aid in classroom participation. 

Without high-quality classroom acoustics, teachers fatigue because they have to strain their voices, and the children fatigue because they have to strain to ""concentrate and hear."" 

Students will use the microphone when they share their journals, when we do readings, and whenever they present.  Beneficial reasons for using a classroom amplification system can include the following: *Increased student attentiveness in the classroom
*Reduced stress levels for teachers
*Reduced health problems related to teacher voice strain
*Better lesson comprehension by students
*Better language and literacy test scores for students at every level
*Increased student interaction and participation in lessons
*Increased student confidence and motivation
*Better performance by students learning English as a foreign language

My students are naturally inquisitive, enthusiastic, and creative individuals.  They are quick to latch on to a new concept or skill, and they make an interesting activity fun for everyone involved.  Unfortunately, because of societal cues and enormous academic pressures, they do not always believe in themselves.  Many of them battle low self-esteem daily. These awesome kids are mostly from first or second generation immigrant families.  We have students from West Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and South Asia. 

In music class the only thing they love more than singing is playing percussion instruments!  I have many drums and blocks and tambourines, but no instruments with pitches like xylophones.  So they are limited in the accompaniments they can create with songs. 

The mallet percussion instruments I'm requesting are kid-sized but they are NOT toys.  They are high-quality, tuned-percussion instruments. Orff percussion instruments allow them to safely improvise melodies, accompany each other, and engage in a truly creative process together. These instruments are called ""Orff"" instruments after the German composer Carl Orff who believed that children should have a safe, child-centered environment to learn music.  Today, his approach to music education is used all over the world, and I would love to start this approach with my students. I intend to use these instruments at every grade level I teach: Kindergarten to 5th grade.  The activities will vary by age and ability level, and the benefits will be felt by all. The soprano xylophone has real rosewood bars and the alto ""metallophone"" has metal bars that have a beautiful, sustaining tone.  The high- quality sound of these instruments is part of what inspires students to create on them. 

Help me create a safe space and activities during school where the students' innate talents are valued.  Increasing their self-esteem, I believe, is imperative to their academic success and to their development as young individuals!"

The materials for this project will allow us to bring the ocean to life in the classroom. Many of my students have never seen the ocean, let alone a Coral Reef. Weekly observations of the changing habitat in this miniature ocean will allow students to experience the wonders of the reef. We will be able to record the ever changing life of the ocean floor once the tank is set up and I have added the live rock and fish. 
I can't take the students on a field trip to the Coral Reef, but I can try and bring a little taste of the reef into the classroom. By giving the students the opportunity to see up close the wonders that can happen overnight in a saltwater tank, they can better understand the need to preserve our Coral Reefs. It will bring their research to life, inspiring them to make a difference and hopefully one day they will be able to visit a Coral Reef up close and personal.

I am a teacher of special needs children with significant ""different"" abilities in a high poverty school.  One of the biggest challenges for my students is communicating their needs and wants. 

My students may lack the physical ability to communicate their needs, feelings, and thoughts but they have no lack of desire for communication.  When my students go into regular education related arts classes, lunch, library, special events, and recess they try to communicate with others but find it difficult to make their voice heard. Other students and staff speak with them but often I or my assistants speak for them or they communicate non-verbally like shaking their head or smiling. 

In order for my students to truly have a voice a communication device is needed.  I am requesting 2 voice output communication devices which are portable...the Go Talk 4+.  This device can mounted on a wheelchair or carried and utilized both in and outside the classroom.  When we are going to the cafeteria, food choices can be programmed in and students can push the button on the device to tell the cafeteria person what their choice is at lunch.  When transitioning to related arts areas, students can use their device to answer yes/no questions, show excitement for an activity, or make choices of different kinds.  It gives them their ""voice"" and makes them feel respected and valued. When going to the lunch room, they struggle to communicate their food choices which causes some frustration for them. 

Your donation will make an enormous impact on my students! You will give them a voice which will last a lifetime."

Each year I begin by creating a warm, happy, and safe place where they can be themselves without ridicule or put downs. We are all in it together as a family!  

We are on the southside of Oklahoma City. Most of my students are Hispanic. This is my fifth year to be in this school. It's a relatively small elementary school for OKCPS. We have wonderful students and families. It's a great place to call home. Every year I begin by telling them we are all family and will treat each other like family. We are with these people in this room most of the day for five days a week. They spend more time with me and each other than they do at home during the school year. All 25 of them are really sweet, funny, and caring kids. They make me laugh every day. They are generous and kind to me at all times. Every year I say I don't know if I can love a class like this one, and every year I love the new class just as much or more. They are a part of my life and a part of my heart forever.  

Several years ago the students were asked to keep Data Notebooks. They track and graph their grades. They set goals they can see each time they open the notebook. They update their attendance every day and strive to meet our 96% attendance goal. In the past three years of this requirement, I have had my homeroom and the other fifth grade so I've always managed to save my own money for this particular reason; however, next year the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade will rotate classes through a total of six teachers, ie: Science, Math 1, Math 2, Reading, Writing, and Social Studies. And they are all required to have these notebooks. So, we've agreed to color coordinate our bulletin boards in the hallway with the color of the corresponding color tab in the Data Notebooks. We want to make it as organized as possible and easy for the students to keep up with their work. Three grades, two classes each for a total of 160 students. 

Your donation will buy for them the colored index tabs that I cannot afford for all 160 of the students. We, the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade teachers, feel this is an excellent way for them to be organized, prepared, and ready for their day to day responsibilities. The notebooks will be available to the parents on parent/teacher nights in order for them to see what their child is doing in each class. I have used this system for the past two years with much success!"

You've probably heard about it in the news, or maybe you're a tech-savvy iPod user who downloads Podcasts regularly.  A Podcast is simply a digital audio file that is available for others to download and listen to.  Podcasts are easy to produce and share, and yet they are a revolutionary way for the voices of ordinary people to be heard.  I would like to harness the power of this new technology for the benefit of my students.   Imagine audiobooks, student news radio, recorded book reviews, interviews, and more -- all online in the students' own voices.

By teaching students how to express themselves verbally, I will help them develop lifelong speaking skills.  By sharing Podcasts with a school-wide ? and worldwide ?  audience, students will build confidence while gaining an authentic purpose for their work.  In addition, our electronic library of student-created Podcasts will serve as a resource for other students.  We will begin by Podcasting student book reviews in grades 4-6, which will integrate with our Literature and Writing curriculum.  The project will then be expanded to include all grades.

All students will be able to download and listen to the Podcasts on their classroom or home computers.  Access will be expanded beyond computers with the requested 2 iPods.  These will allow students to listen to book reviews while browsing the classroom library -- without having to wait for a computer to be available.  If this project is funded, there will be headphone, microphone, and iPod sets available for teachers to check out so their students may record and listen to Podcasts.

I am the Technology and Media Specialist at Burley School in Chicago.  I work with grades K-8 and have seen the impact that technology can have on a student's learning, creativity, and self-esteem.  When students express themselves through multimedia, they feel an incredible sense of pride, and are often able to convey concepts and emotions that are difficult to capture in writing alone.  Multimedia can also increase participation from learners of all different abilities, including those who struggle to read and write or are learning disabled.  Plus, being able to read and write is no longer enough -- students need to be fluent in multimedia communication and the tools of the 21st century.  However, our school budget is shrinking every year, and we find ourselves unable to provide the tools that make these experiences possible.

I have fourteen fifth graders that range in age from 10-11. My students come from various cultural and economic backgrounds. Our school lies within a very small, rural community in Tennessee in which many families are faced with a low-income. 

Our school atmosphere is absolutely amazing. Students, teachers, and other faculty and staff operate as one big family. Students are welcomed at the door each morning by our principal and greeted at the classroom door by their teacher. The students are eager to learn and impress their parents, teachers, principal, and community. They go above and beyond each day to make us all proud. 

My students will use the Math manipulatives to develop an understanding of difficult mathematical concepts through a hands-on experience. The math manipulative library that I hope to receive will help bring several lessons to life for my students. For example, students will be able to use the fraction multipliers to create their own visual representation of fraction multiplication. Teach the multiplication of fractions can be tricky. However, by creating and seeing a visual representation of this skill, my students will be able to learn exactly how fractions are multiplied together to form a product. 

Students will be able to use the area blocks to depict models of figures and measure their area and perimeter in terms of units. My students will be able to use the manipulatives to learn how to apply measuring area and perimeter to real objects rather than just figures on paper. Each set of manipulatives will bring math lessons to life in my class. 

Fifth grade math can be very challenging for students. It makes it even tougher when students are expected to learn simply by paper and pencil examples. By using the Math manipulatives, my students will be able to get a better understanding of challenging mathematical concepts through hands-on experiences.

My students are from a small rural public school district with a 64% free and reduced lunch rate. Many students cannot afford their own school supplies, let alone resources that allow them to independently reinforce what they have already learned.

However, my students are amazing this year! They have the willingness to learn and the ability to do so. My students need me to read multiple books to them each and everyday. I believe that having additional resources in our classroom will allow students to become better readers and foster a love of math and science. 

I am requesting a variety of books that will allow me to help my students become readers in all subject areas. Many times we focus on reading just during reading time for Kindergarten students, but we need resources that will allow students to hear stories, make connections and gain comprehension in areas such as math, science and social studies, as well.

The King Series Bundle of books will allow me to work with small groups during guided reading. The books with a math emphasis will allow me to read to students about the math standards we are learning. I also requested several books about weather to use during science. The King Series books are meant to be read by the students and the other books are meant to be read aloud to the students. 

Your generosity will help my students by purchasing books to help facilitate their learning across multiple curricular areas. I appreciate the time you have taken to look at my proposal. My students will value the time spent reading with them and to them."

Students have been baking and doing no-stove cooking.  The students wanted to learn stove-top cooking, but with only one stove for about 10 students, we can't.  They decided that we could buy ""little stoves"" for everyone.  The students also noticed that we did not have enough cooking tools (measuring cups, spatulas) for everyone.   

Having the supplies for cooking lessons will help students understand math in a real life setting (measuring, cook / bake time, etc.). Cooking lessons in a controlled (i.e. classroom) setting would allow staff to teach food and kitchen safety; additionally, knowing how to cook would allow students to prepare meals for themselves after high school, for their family, and members of their community. 

Our goal is to get more cooking supplies, because we are running out and don't have enough. We are trying to learn how to cook, and we need more supplies so we could cook more food. 

We picked out the supplies that we wanted to cook with.  Once we have the supplies, we will cook different meals that we might eat at home (spaghetti, tacos).  We also will share our meals with our parents and other teachers. 

Our goal is get more supplies to learn how to cook. Our classroom has limited supplies, making lessons challenging. Having more supplies would make it easier for students to learn necessary life skills like cooking, and would allow them to excel."

This means that 70% of students receive free or reduced lunch.  The majority of the students who attend this school are of Filipino, Native Hawaiian, and Samoan descent.  My students are from low socioeconomic communities; yet, they continue to strive for the highest goals.  I witness my students persevering daily, especially my English Language Learners, who try extremely hard to keep up academically with their peers. 

We are not fortunate to have a class set of laptops and share a mobile lab with another class.  The entire mobile lab still does not have enough laptops to service the number of students in my class.  With the tablets, I am able to conduct class lessons with all of my students at the same time instead of having some students sit out and watch because we do not have enough laptops to go around.  I would like to encourage my students to use the tablets to conduct various research projects for social studies and science.  I would also like to utilize the many apps that are available to teach my students how to record themselves reading so that they are able to listen to themselves and improve their fluency skills.  My dream is to have these tablets readily accessible in language arts and math centers.

Having a document camera in the classroom will allow lesson plans to be more time efficient and interactive. It will allow for different ways to clarify and engage students by modeling and showing them what is exemplar work. In addition, students will be able to share their work with other students creating a collaborative environment. A document camera will change the dynamic in my classroom because students will be able to understand concepts with greater ease and be able to visually see what needs to be done. 

An document camera is of utmost importance because it is updated technology that is simple, yet life changing.

Shiny new backpacks are proudly hung on chairs but not for long. Pretty soon the carpet is hardly visible under a sea of backpacks. 

My school, like all schools, is attempting to keep up with the technology necessary to teach in the 21st Century.
Funds for things like backpack carts are not readily available although something so simple can make a huge difference. My students are eleven going on eighteen. These days, they are motivated by screen time and ""likes."" My goal is to inspire them to talk (in person!) with one another and learn to learn from others instead of Google. Their attention spans are minimal. They need to move. I incorporate kinesthetic brain breaks and chances to move within a lesson whenever possible, but with so little space, it is getting to be more of a challenge. 

Our classroom was built for 20 to 25 students, but with more budget cuts came higher class sizes. All these growing preteens need big backpacks that create clutter and unsafe tripping hazards. I am a teacher who values kinesthetic learning and peer interactions in a time where sedentary and anti-social habits formed over the summer can be hard to break. But, we need more ROOM in our room!
 

A backpack cart would allow for more movement, less clutter and more space for creative group activities.

Without thirty plus backpacks in the way, I will have room for things like science labs and inclement weather physical education (yoga, anyone?). These kinds of hands-on, kinesthetic lessons are the ones that students will remember forever."

I currently have one camera and although it is very difficult sharing a single camera with 20 students, I have managed to pull it off. Having a second camera would be incredible and double our photo-taking time. My students would be able to have more individual time learning camera functions and gaining experience taking pictures. My students need a camera, batteries and a memory card for our photography course. 

Students experience so much change during their high school years. They are always looking for outlets for their emotions and ways to excel and express their individuality. It is rare to find a student who isn't interested in photography. If you help us obtain a camera, you will make it possible for more than one student to excel in a subject they love. You will help them find an outlet for their emotions.

Our diverse population comes together for the K-8 years and then divides into regional high school. As the only mandatory performing arts class in the building, it is my responsibility to prepare these students for a lifetime of arts appreciation. I aim to develop discerning, critical ears and minds that are challenged and intrigued by art. In my general music class, we journey through the world and create musical experiences as often as we are audience to them. Dance, drama, opera and theater as well as performance art is all included in our study of visual arts. My students are technologically savvy, inquisitive and creative on the whole. 

By incorporating this piece of music technology into the comprehensive music class, I can provide a deep and wide musical vocabulary of experiences for these students to take with them into adulthood. My aim is to prepare students for an ever changing world in the arts and an effective way to touch their lives is to provide relevant, current examples of that art. Electronic music is prevalent in our culture and will usher in the next wave of musical composition. With this instrument, students who do not benefit from conventional (band/orchestra) musical performance ensembles may gain a voice. Students who are physically unable to hold an instrument may enjoy the same connection to a theremin as others may have to a conventional instrument by having pitch and timbre changed through physical proximity. Students who are advanced in their musical studies may enjoy a different experience with the theremin.

This project would not be funded through traditional means. Our board of education is supportive, however, through DonorsChoose.org, this exceptional grant may be filled by music enthusiasts and passionate members of the community. Please support this kind of innovative musical programming because the children that benefit from it today are our nation's future."

My kiddos have a love for learning that I strive to instill from day 1.  They are emergent readers of varying backgrounds. Many have a home language other than English. 

Many children take great pleasure in listening to stories. Listening to audio books while following along with a copy of the book is particularly valuable because students are able to follow along as the narrator reads. This is the reason I am trying to get 6 Kindle Fires for my classroom. My students will be able to use them to scan QR codes on books in my listening library and follow along in the book with the story being read. 

Hearing a book read aloud helps students see how the words on the page can come alive in a fluid, expressive way. It helps them focus on the sounds of words read without interruption and provides a model of fluent reading. Audio books also give students an important introduction to listening, a skill that must be mastered in order to learn to read. These tablets with sturdy ""kid-proof"" cases will allow my students the freedom to roam the classroom and find a comfortable place to enjoy a book.

While they are still students in elementary school, we have an opportunity to help them develop the skills to keep themselves organized.  By creating areas designated for storage of different materials, I will be able to help my students practice keeping track of their work - an incredibly valuable life skill.

My students are 25 fifth graders in California. They have access to technology at home and some technology at school, but would benefit from learning technology skills in the general education classroom. My students attend a public school, and truly enjoy learning. 

As we are now in the digital age, it is important that students learn how to integrate technology into their academics. By providing my students with as many technological tools as possible, I am supplying them with different modes to express themselves. 

My project is so important because my students will truly use this technology in the classroom and apply these skills at home. The technology will be a tool to use as enrichment for the curriculum."

Our seventh and eighth grade middle school is in a suburban town; our kids are people of character and good will, and they strive to give and be their best. They like to read, to think, to argue, to create. They participate in local, state, and national contests of imagination and ingenuity, as well as creativity. They produce an award-winning literary magazine every year, and they are grateful for the gifts they have in their lives. 

Dioramas are a thing of the past. Today's students create scripts and movies, visions, and artwork - indeed, they create entire worlds digitally! 

Our school has been gifted with iPads for all of the teachers, and two carts of 25 iPads each, but there is no way that's enough for every kid, or even every classroom. I have four specifically for my classroom.  If we could add two more iPads to our classroom, dedicated to my 90 students, it would greatly increase our ability to extend their learning and their creativity.  That would bring our total to six iPads in our classroom, every group would be able to use one, and our classroom ""set"" would be complete! 

Even in a district where money is less of an issue than in other places, resources can be scarce. Two more iPads would make a world of difference to my students, increasing their digital awareness and skills, while also allowing students whose parents cannot afford these learning tools the opportunity to take advantage of this increasingly common technology.

This particular class needs many opportunities for visual student engagement especially since many of my students are English Language Learners and need the visual aids to support their learning a new language development. It is also highly crucial that all students at the elementary level receive the necessary visual engagement to aid in learning.   

I am in desperate need of a projector to use along with my new ELMO document camera as it cannot be used without a projector.

Learning becomes fun and the students are learning in a safe, fun, engaging and successful learning environment. In my classroom now, I do my best to provide visual aides but overall it is very challenging and is not nearly as engaging as it would be on a projector.

The Rusty Raiders Project is a tribute to the students that had the drive to create a science project that was more than a simple classroom activity. It's how students are making a change. 

Our school is a small rural school near one of the tributaries of the Thunder Bay River.  Our school is rated as having a high rate of poverty; nearly eighty-five percent of our students qualify for free and reduced lunch. Our students are not defined by their socioeconomic status but by their commitment to make our community a better place of all its citizens. In today's global economy, it is essential that students possess the skills that will increase the students' ability to be successful academically. They need to have experiences in which they can apply the knowledge. 

The students have transformed the classroom from an institute that takes from the community to one that is a productive contributor to the success of the community. The students become participants rather than observers. They are no longer sitting in their desks waiting for the information, but actively seeking it and sharing it. 

This project requires the students to develop essays as each phase of the project is completed and a formal science conclusion at the end of this year's research. It also requires students to collect data, manipulate that data, and report for the purpose of reaching a conclusion. All of this work needs to be done at school, because all the computers are networked to one large server that keeps all the student files. 

Most the students have computers at home and would love the opportunity to continue work outside the classroom. District police dictates that students are not allowed to bring files from home and open them at the school for fear of passing along a virus. We have a very strong and available Wi-Fi in our school, but we have little to no technology to use it. The Chromebooks would allow us to take advantage of the available Wi-Fi and allow students to store documents, presentations, and reports online, so that they could access them at any time or any place. 

My students need these 6 Samsung Chromebooks to help them create local and state awareness in the battle to defeat aquatic invasive species.

It is not the curriculum objectives that are the true goal of the project, it is the underlining inquiry process that makes the project important to the development of the students involved. The true goal is to make my students become problem solvers that want to be self-actuating contributors to the community. The students become problem solvers and they learn how to find answers for themselves. The students gain confidence in themselves and they grow to become productive citizens."

Many of my students can not afford to buy basic school supplies.  They rely on our school's stored supplies, which are now dwindling even further with the 300 extra students we are now housing from a storm ravished school. 

My ultra-energetic sixth graders are a very diverse group.  Many of them live in one of the largest public housing projects in the North America.  Many of them are eager for the attention that they do not necessarily receive at home.  They receive all of that and more here at school. 

Students in my science class sometimes end up having to work in groups larger than I would like because of lack of basic science, as well as stationary supplies.  If I were to receive the graduated cylinders I have asked for, more of my students will be able to actively participate in some of our lab activities at the same time.  The chart paper and markers will allow them to share their results more effectively with class, and therefore take more pride in themselves as learners, and as teachers for their peers.

My amazing students come from a very low-income ""at risk"" inner-city neighborhood in New York. I have students of various ethnic backgrounds creating a beautiful mix of cultures and personalities. This is especially evident in music class. My outstanding principal has rescued these kids--literally. Their school was closed for failing state standards only two years ago. In that time, we have turned it into an A school! We also just recently passed our quality review with flying colors, and our staff was not surprised. We are extremely hard workers who truly love our jobs and our children. Even with limited resources, we know that with hard work, high expectations, and true care, we will create a lasting impact on the lives of each and every one of these children. The arts are at the forefront of my principal's vision. I aim to complete each child's education by giving them the tools to express themselves musically,and to understand the place and power of music in the world around them. 

The keyboard is the most clearly laid out instrument, and it is also the most accessible. Without having to develop a degree of technique, a tone can be produced immediately at any age, yet the possibilities are endless! They can apply keyboard skills to any genre of music and can use it to compose as well! My goal is to eventually have 28 keyboards to teach an entire class at one time. Orff instrument ensembles are a way for students to learn to listen to one another and play harmoniously, and it provides a way for students to focus on the core elements of musicianship while creating a beautiful acoustic sound, that only gets richer when more kids are playing. My band is only in its second year. Countless parents came to me after our recent winter arts fest, almost in tears at how proud they were of the children, even if it wasn't their own! Without working reeds, they cannot produce sound on their instrument. The drum set will allow children to explore coordination and modern music. 

My children come from an environment filled with pain and hardship; the kind of environment where music is most important, and where creativity is not a hobby, but a lifeline. I have a third grader writing a song about how her father died that brought the other children and I to tears. I have students with every reason to not believe in themselves, but when they see what they are capable of through music,and that a song is a world unto itself where all things can be made perfect, change happens."

Inside, a chicken delivery notice! My students will research and design proper homes and care items to keep the chickens alive. 

My students live in one of the poorest and violent neighborhoods in our large urban city. Students at my school don't have backyards or open space, raising chickens or planting gardens is not every day life. At our school, we nurture the innate curiosities of the child. We foster exploration and hands-on learning through learning expeditions that get students out of the classroom. We develop inquiry based trimester-long units of study that seek to answer real world questions and problems. Students work hands-on with primary and secondary sources to conduct research. Experts and field work sites serve as a way to enhance students' learning as a connection to the real world. These students rarely get experiences outside of their neighborhood and this experience of researching and designing the perfect living space for our growing eggs and soon chickens will provide a rich learning opportunity, as well as lifelong memories. 

Students will get these supplies in order to support the work they will do in raising their chickens. These supplies will help them research the best way to care for fertilized eggs, and soon hatchlings. We need these supplies to keep our eggs, chicks, and soon to be adult chickens alive! We will use the egg candlers to know when our eggs are about to hatch! We will use the heat lamp and the thermometer to keep our chicks warm. Throughout this process, students will gain valuable skills in perseverance and grit by revising their work (designing incubators, brooding boxes, and a coop) and problem solving. In the end, students will compile their research into a ""how to care for urban chickens"" guide that they will sell at a local farmers market. Our goal is to not only educate our 3rd graders, but create opportunities for them to be active citizens in their community! 

This will not only be a fulfilling reading, writing, and science learning opportunity, but this will be a learning opportunity that will light a spark for future learning. This is a project about rigorous academic standards as well as creating learning experiences that will inspire a life long love of learning."

Our students are a very diverse group of eager learners.  General education, special education, and second language learners make up our population.  Being an urban school our students thrive upon this diversity, but the urban nature of our school also brings funding challenges.  Regardless of the challenges our students have school spirit that makes our students and school special.  Our students are willing and waiting for engaging curriculum to challenge them to be at their best. 

Our students are thirsty for learning experiences that challenge their understanding of the world.  When exposed to new concepts, like model based curriculum, they dive in, make mistakes, learn from those mistakes, and build new understandings.  The sharing of student ideas is fundamental to our model based curriculum.  By giving students the supplies to conduct experiments on photosynthesis and cellular respiration, growth and development, and cellular regeneration, students will have plenty of data to observe, create scientific models, and share their understanding through poster presentations with their peers.  The student to student sharing is the heart of this curriculum which the donations will provide the tools necessary for this process.  Students report this engaging and creative process of model based reasoning is what they find new to their learning, and soon, ""Not school as usual,"" becomes a welcome theme. 

With the adoption of NGSS, science instruction is becoming model based which necessitates a strong ability to think critically.  Students helping students by building critical thinking and collaborative skills through the development of scientific models will be skills that students can use in every aspect of their life for years to follow."

Many of my students are refugees from camps in Eastern Africa. I have several students who have been in the country for only a  few years.  Yet, many of them are not sure where their roots have come from. I will be using the books to take our class to Africa. This will be a learning adventure for everyone, giving insight into the animals and culture.  

The second unit I will be teaching is a unit on plant life. I will be using hands-on manipulatives to teach students about plant ecology. We will be planting our own classroom garden and transplanting the plants to the local community garden. Children will learn about the benefits of growing their own food, as well as, understanding plant growth. One of the items is a plant growth kit where students can visually see the growth of plant roots. 

The best lessons are taught through children learning through their own experiences. We all remember being in school and those few lessons that stood out amongst the rest.  

The materials I have asked for will give students these lasting memories that will allow for them to carry their knowledge into the world.  Having students studying about different parts of the world as well as, the environmental life around them can have lasting educational impacts in their life."

My classroom consists of 21 vibrant and eager to learn kindergarten students.  My students attend a Title 1, high poverty, urban public school. Approximately 75% of my students are from a family of English Language Learners (ELL). A high percentage  my students receive free and reduced lunch. 

My students will benefit from this carpet because we all need a place to call our own...we need our personal space. My students will be able to follow directions as I send them back to their seats according to the color square they are sitting on. The students will be able to manage their own behavior in terms of paying attention, something that kindergarten students have a difficult time doing because of their age. 

I like to start with a mini lesson as a whole group on the rug before students go back to their seats to assure they understand what we are learning and the expectations for table work. We do our morning meeting on the rug. The children also read books on the rug when they finish their work early and listen to stories being read to them on the rug. A lot takes place on the rug on a daily basis. 

We currently have a solid, bland color oval rug that has replaced the one just like the one we are requesting. Unfortunately, they were in  bad condition and our budget wouldn't allow us to repurchase the same one again.

 A Kindergarten classroom should be as bright, vibrant and welcoming as the children that are there to learn. The children love to have something to call their own. This carpet will allow them their own space as well as a child-friendly learning environment.

My students read far-below or below grade level. They become frustrated when they try to read and often times give-up, creating a vicious cycle. I have been able to use my own money to set-up a comfortable reading area (see picture), and I have access to grade-level audio books. What I lack is CD players for the students to listen to those audio books! These books have been selected because they teach valuable life lessons (for example, The Mighty), and are high interest. It is my desire to expose my students to this great literature. 

I cannot imagine the frustration my students feel knowing they cannot access material others around them can. I know if they are able to hear these books read to them, they would feel successful. This success would surely build upon itself, breaking the cycle of the feeling of failure. This would be a wonderful experience for both my students, me, and those who help make it possible.

I also included two Spanish versions of the stories:  ""I Went Walking"" and ""Jump Frog Jump"". My students can use the listening center to correctly hear and read along with proper English. Then they can listen to the Spanish version to really understand the content of the story. I would much rather teach content during reading time, instead of just focusing on the same old phonics sounds that more the students. This is a great way to make content accessible to my students who are just learning English, and they can do it all by themselves!

Please help me supply my students with read alongs for their listening center. As of now I only have 6 read alongs, 2 of which I copied and recorded my own CD for. It is only October and many of my students are already bored of reading the same books over and over again. The read alongs that I chose are from Lakeshore Learning. I cannot afford to buy more than 1 or 2 of these sets for my students."

My students will use the iPad Mini each day to help reinforce phonics, word building, fluency, and comprehension during our reading block. Phonics is the key to beginning reading. First graders need to hear as they read and learn their letter sounds. There are several reading apps that will benefit all of my students. Learning the basic math facts is important to first graders. There are several apps that allow the students to manipulate objects to help them see the true meaning of a number sentence. My first graders will also use the iPad do activities through Compass Learning and Stride Academy. These websites provide each student with activities on their skill level.

We began recruiting girls for our club last year and have been able to offer them several outdoor experiences to this point. We have worked hard to incorporate a love of the outdoors with a sense of female empowerment. We have taken them indoor rock climbing, hiking at the Indiana Dunes, bicycling along the lakefront (after a bicycle repair workshop where they learned to tune-up their bikes and fix flat tires) and ice skating at Millennium Park. Being able to share these adventures with them has been amazing...and we don't want it to stop. 

Unfortunately, our money is running out. Our principal has been gracious enough to help us fund our trips so far, but there isn't any more money available for our club. We don't want to abandon this club, but also know that we cannot fund the trips on our own. 

In our last meeting, the girls decided that they would like to visit the Chicago Botanic Gardens during the winter. The Japanese garden is designed to be viewed after a snowfall and we would love to share this beauty with our students. We want to open their eyes to the beauty in the every day and the nature that is available in their ""backyard.""

Kids, we’ll have to stop here and continue reading tomorrow.""
""NOOOOO!""
Do you remember having stories read aloud to you, and a world of imagination and creativity being opened as the story played out in your mind? My students need more time to listen & learn! 

My third-grade students absolutely love read alouds…they sit quietly at the meeting area rug and listen attentively to the stories I read to them. Hearing good literature prompts such wonderful discussions and gets the students thinking critically and making personal connections. As English Language Learners, they need greater exposure to the language, and they need to be provided more opportunities for vocabulary and language development. Most of my students come from households where English is spoken infrequently, if at all – this makes school time the only opportunity for them to hear good models of the English language. Also, almost half of my class is currently reading below grade level - they need the chance to strengthen their fluency and comprehension. Unfortunately, there is not enough time within the school day for me to read stories to them more than once or twice. There are even days where we won’t even have time to read together once, and this really disappoints my class! 

Having a listening center and audio-visual materials would enable my students to listen independently to books on tapes/CD throughout the school day, particularly during Reader’s Workshop and content area instruction (Science/Social Studies). While the entire class will have access to the materials, those students who have been identified as at-risk (reading far below grade-level) will be able to utilize the listening center as additional intervention. Listening to stories will help my students improve their reading fluency, expression, phrasing, and pace. Students will not have to wait until our Read Aloud time to listen to good literature with me - they can utilize a listening center and listen to books being read aloud from their own seats at different times throughout the day. This will, in turn, help to improve their own reading fluency, rate, & comprehension - now more of my students will be able to read independently on or above grade level standards! 

Granting students more opportunities to hear literature read aloud in a more independent way will give them the motivation and tools to strengthen their own reading fluency and comprehension. I want all of my students to be able to read independently on or even above grade-level expectations. A listening center would really aid in giving my struggling readers more time and resources to strengthen their abilities. Thank you in advance for helping our class listen and learn!"

Leveled books will allow my students to find the book that best suits their needs, as well as, help engage them in reading. 
Your generous donations will inspire the imaginations and explorations of young minds.  Please help us build our Classroom Library by supporting this project. Your contribution will help provide books for students to take part in their own academic careers. With these leveled books, students will be able to access a book of their choosing on their reading level with ease. Students will be able to locate their reading level, and then find the book that interests them the most. They will be able to find where their interests lie and eventually seek out knowledge on their own.

They typically don't have books at home and they have not developed a life long love of literacy. They lack the background knowledge to effectively pick out books that are meaningful and will enrich their lives. They would greatly benefit from having a rich source of material in their classroom. Students who learn to discuss books with peers are more likely to develop a love of learning in general along with stronger critical thinking skills and a broadened vocabulary. 

Resources requested will be used as a class book study in which students will be able to analyze material in depth with their peers and discuss cultural relevance. The Book Thief ties into World War II and encourages in-depth conversation of social issues surrounding students on a daily basis. They are able to make connections to their own lives including bullying and prejudice which are very much problems they are familiar with. Other readings from Scholastic Scope provide up-to-date information about current issues with which students can gleam valuable information while learning common core objectives.

I am privileged to have two literacy blocks of 30-35 3rd grade scholars this year.  While I have yet to meet my 60+ scholars, I know that they will be eager to learn and have a strong desire to excel in order to eventually graduate from college.  I know that my scholars will be loving, fun, and excited about what the world of literature has to offer.  My school is in its second year of operation after having closed in 2004, and it has already created a strong culture of love, leadership, and excellence.

Anchor charts are EVERYWHERE!  Posters made with the chart paper are critical for daily lessons and classroom culture.  Our literacy curriculum is fantastic, and much of it cannot be properly executed without the aid of pre-made posters and literacy resources to use each day.  My students should have all of the materials that are needed in order to succeed in their literacy block each day.  Additionally, anchor charts will be used to post the lyrics to classroom chants, which will create a sense of classroom pride and family, for example: ""The more we read the more we know!  And when we know, to college we'll go!""  Anchor charts are also used to post classroom procedures and rules in order to help scholars understand how to make good choices during school and set them up for success each day. 

Your donation to this project will make all of the difference to the entire third grade team.  Something as small as a piece of chart paper can change lives because it ensures that we save time by having definitions, terms, and quotes pre-written.

We started implementing this series of books last year and they are wonderful!  They are colorful, fun, and read like a story instead of a boring list of facts.  The information is presented on every page with a main idea paragraph, pictures, captions, maps, charts graphs, and pictures featuring sequences of events.  There are many different types of information presented in each book that is not only fun but tested on the MCAS in history and also as reading skills on the Language Arts test.  Not only that but they are not as intimidating as a 600 page text book - you can actually carry them around, finish a story, and feel a sense of accomplishment. 

These books have been tested now it's time to use them.  Your help will let students be able to hold and read their own copies of the books instead of having to share one with the whole class.  Your help will make reading about history, fun, accessible, and interesting.  Who knows at the end of the day maybe they will even remember it."

We offer many after school programs for our students to enhance student learning in the classroom. Our physical education program is trying to offer activities that students can use at home with little equipment. 

We want our students to be active as much as possible and encourage home life to actively participation in movement.  

Our students will be using this equipment to create a rhythm movement or a dance. We are pairing with our music department in their Project Based Learning to create a rap and dance to present to our school. Our students will also help create chants to say during Double Dutch that help reinforce math and English skills learned in the classroom. 

These activities will help students create team building skills and allow student an opportunity to showcase their creativity.  

Our students will have an opportunity to create something special. The Project Based Learning that music and physical education classes are incorporating gives students opportunities to teach our school new ways to create rhythm and dance using jump ropes.

I can lecture them, read to them, show them websites and yet they will remember what we DO much more than anything else.  I want to give my students many ways to use their five senses while observing life.  I want to motivate their curiosity and inspire them to investigate. 

My students come to me with minimal background experiences.  Most of them are limited English speakers from low-socioeconomic backgrounds.  This means I need to do everything I can to motivate and build experiences for my students that strengthen their vocabulary and build background and content knowledge.  Providing them with live organisms to investigate ignites their curiosity and compels them to investigate. They learn so much more when they are in charge of their own learning. They record their observations, use books and websites to find out more, and all the while are building valuable reading, writing, vocabulary, observation, and research skills. 

This project requests a variety of aquarium and terrarium supplies including one Back to the Roots Water Garden, one KollerCraft Aquarius Aquarium Kit with LED Lighting and Internal Power Filter, Glofish Aquarium Gravel, Black with Fluorescent Highlights, and 6 Pcs Assorted Color Aquarium Plastic Plant Decoration w Ceramic Base.

I plan to set up the aquariums in a science lab center.  The center will also include a terrarium with plants, snails, and insects. When students go to the center they will have access to science journals, clipboards, hand lenses, rulers, and books for research. They will visit the center three times each week; each time choosing one of the three different life stations so they will have a chance to observe all three habitats during the week.  While at the center they will get to measure organisms, draw and label what they see, and record any changes they may find in the environment.  They will get to share their observations and questions once a week as we discuss what is happening in the habitats. 

With new aquariums and terrariums my students will have a chance to really experience life science, and they will remember so much more than any book can teach them alone.  My students will engage in science and the higher order thinking skills involved in applying what they have learned.  They will also learn the value of caring for the environment and discovering the difference between wants and needs in life.  All of this will lead them to take their knowledge with them and hopefully apply what they have learned throughout their life."
fb83264ade399c045ee8bdf5d7e79aab,My students need cool books!  I've had success showing kids that reading can be rewarding by supplying them titles geared to their interests.  Please help!,2011-12-08,Books,253.35000000000002,298.06,http://donorschoose.org/project/692500,Grades 9-12,completed,2012-05-06,298.05,2011-12-14,No,Yes,"Most of my students are low income and re-classified English Language learners, which only add to the problem of convincing any teenager that reading is more fun that playing on a cell phone.  The state of California and Title One used to fund my annual book shopping trip, but not any more.  

My kids are great.  Our school is 95% Latino, with a little Pacific Islander mixed in.  Most of them are from working-class families, and many of their parents are not fluent in English, which means reading is often not pushed upon them in the home.  Very few of them have significant libraries at home.

My students, all tenth graders, have a good attitude about wanting to get smarter, wanting to do well in school, and wanting to go to college, but they also want to have fun a little too much.  By showing them that reading is a rewarding pastime, I get them to build their literacy skills on their own time, outside of what we do in class.  I have a reading library from which kids are free to check out books, and I find that when I target their interests, many of them do.  Once I find that a kid is interested in a certain genre, I can usually move them up in reading difficulty within that same genre, without their awareness that they're being pushed.  These kids are well worth your help. 

What I've selected is an assortment of reading titles of interest to teenagers.  I know from past experience what kids like to read.  I've got two of the Twilight books on the list, which are very popular right now.  I've got two Nicholas Sparks books for those who like romance.  I've got two of the Cirque du Freak series, which are very popular, and a good gateway book.  I've got A.C. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, soon in a theatre near you -- kids always like to read the current movie.  I've got the two Crank poetry books, which have disappeared off my shelf before.  I got a collection of short stories by Ray Bradbury, since we just finished Fahrenheit 451 as a class.  I've got books of true crime, a book about the Lakers, and books about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.  I really don't care what the kids are reading, as long as they READ.  Hopefully together, we can make it fun for them. 

Advancing their reading skills is critical to my students' chances of being successful in college, and teaching them it can be fun helps foster their growth.  A great majority of my students plan on going to college, but many of them are either not yet aware or not realistic about what the reading demands are going to be.  I try to explain this to them, and that the magic fairy is not going to fly in the window and bless them with reading ability, they have to work on it, like any other skill."

I teach special education Pre-K with two sessions daily.  My morning group has 12 students and my afternoon group has 9.  We are on a general education elementary school campus which is part of a large urban school district in California. My students have disabilities that include autism, developmental delays, speech or language impairment, and attention deficits.  They range in age from 3 to 4 years old.  Although they have disabilities, they come to school excited and ready to learn everyday!   

These alphabet tubs will provide my students a multitude of opportunities to interact and play around with the phonemes that make up words.  This is an essential skill that promotes successful reading as they move through elementary school.  The tubs will allow my students to group, classify and sort objects with similar phonemes in an exciting way! 

Literacy begins way before formal reading instruction in kindergarten and first grade.  Providing opportunities for students to play around with the sounds that make up words, is a great way to develop the phonemic awareness skills all students need before learning to read!  These alphabet tubs will be the key to providing meaningful opportunities to my students!"

The students and I are ready to have a sharpener that will last the entire year.  We would also like to have pencils that keep their points. 

The students are second graders from a Title One school in Florida.  Daily they love to write and illustrate their journal composition books.  The kids dislike writing with dull or broken pencils, it frustrates them. Last year some of my students were able to use the larger pencils and they loved them.   

Thank you in advance for helping my students become better writers.  A joy for writing is something that I want the students to achieve.  At the beginning of the year, most of the students will draw out their stories.  The middle of the year should have all of the students writing at least one full paragraph.  This is only possible if the students are able to write without distractions.  Sharpened pencils are a must! 

Using sharpened pencils and being able to sharpen with ease decreases distractions in the class.  Being able to use a pencil that is comfortable to hold also reduces distractions. Another benefit of the larger pencils is the longer lasting point, which means a longer amount of writing time."

I am a teacher at a child care center in Michigan and I will also be the lead teacher for our summer camp.  This summer we are going to move our camp to a new location.  Our elementary school is going to be under renovation so camp will be located at our high school. Children can come to camp as early as 7:00a.m. and stay as late as 6:00p.m. They are preschoolers through 12 years of age.  Normally we have access to our physical education teachers many pieces of equipment.  Because of our schools large renovation project we will no longer be able to use the equipment.  We will have to get our own for summer camp.  I only have a few recess things at this point. 

Having some new and special physical education equipment will really give the students at summer camp something to look forward to each day as they come to camp. We will now have nets to use to play soccer and hockey. Having cones and poly spots will give us a chance to mark the outdoor spaces for playing. 

It would be great to have the funds for some physical education equipment.  The students will have a special summer doing exciting activities while their parents are at work.  Your help will ensure that summer camp students have the supplies they need to have a summer of fun without extra costs."

This year, our curriculum focuses on ancient civilizations. They have almost zero prior knowledge about any of the civilizations we've studied, but they are always eager to learn. I am committed to using a variety of teaching tools and strategies so that all of the ancient content stays fresh and interesting! 

This proposal requests a set of historical fiction novels, set in ancient China, titled ""The Terracotta Girl."" In addition, I have requested 3 other titles: ""Stranger on the Silk Road,"" ""The Jade Dragon,"" and ""The Emperor's Painting."" Each of the novels focuses on a different aspect of ancient Chinese history or culture. We will read ""The Terracotta Girl"" together as a class, and then the other three texts will be available for independent reading.

My students attend a public school located in a rural area of South Carolina. The children come from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. Since we are an accredited International Baccalaureate school , I try to incorporate as much inquiry and hands on learning as possible. 

The resources provided by this project will provide owl pellets for all of the 3rd grade classes at our school. Through this hands on investigation, the children will work in pairs to dissect an owl pellet and discover an owl's food chain. Since owl pellets can contain a variety of animal skeletons, the children will naturally be encouraged to perform independent and relevant research to determine the types of skeletons discovered. When children experience success in answering their own questions and performing their own investigations,their self confidence as a learner is strengthened. Instead of seeing the teacher as the only learning expert in the room, they see themselves as capable as well. They will then begin to take more responsibility for themselves in all areas of their lives. 

Children learn best when they use all their senses. They learn by ""doing"". Textbooks do not encourage the same level of questions and understanding that an actual hands on experiment can initiate.  Unfortunately, our economy is effecting the amount of money that can be spent on consumable items that need to be replaced once the experiment is finished. Reading a textbook page is simply a short moment in time usually forgotten shortly after; but, a hands on experience will create a lasting memory."

I want my kids to be exposed to cutting edge technology tools that will inspire them to go to greater heights.  It would be great for my students to interface with the netbooks to enhance, reinforce, and explore mathematics. The colored paper and ink will be used for the interactive notebooks. The book is a portfolio of their work. It teaches them notetaking skills and how to be organize. They can also use it  as a reference tool throughout the year.

We have purchased reading programs to supplement our core curriculum.  One of the problems we are now encountering are organizational and spacial issues.  One of our most successful current programs uses tape players, stop watches, pencils, high lighters, student folders and three ring binders.  We are finding that when it is time for the kids to clean up and put things away, we do not have appropriate storage.  Tape players are being stacked on top of themselves, stop watches stuck anywhere and inventory is hard to keep track of.  Because of this, the life of all of the materials and equipment are shortening.  We will have to replace materials in order to keep the program going.  This will get expensive.   

In order to take care of our equipment and model good organizational skills to our children, we have found an organization solution that included two shelving units, two file drawers and some cubbies to keep pencils, timers, highlighters and other odds and ends in.  With this resource, we can use our time wisely, take care of our supplies and teach our kids about good stewardship.  

With this purchase, our students will have order, the successful program will endure and we can spend less of our valuable time looking for items needed and cleaning up after each other.  Your consideration of our project is amazing."

Then as we move through the year, we work on learning to read and write sentences.  Finally, at the end of the year, the students become independent readers and authors. 

The best way for young children to learn is through hands-on materials.  These new kits will be used during reading and writing time in our Literacy Work Stations and in teacher-led small groups.  The students move around the room and self-select activities to complete.
During reading rotations, I will use the Reading Informational Text Centers so that students understand how to focus on finding main ideas in non-fiction books.  The Reading Literature Center will review concepts taught through our basal reader.  The Fiction and Non-Fiction kits are activities that encourage students to find text evidence, determine the main idea, identify key ideas and details, summarize and sequence.  These are all important skills to help students to comprehend what they are reading.
During writing rotations, The Writing Center will be a basic introduction to the different genres of writing.  The Language Skill Center will help teach conventions of Standard English.

The magazine includes age-appropriate non-fiction readings that are interesting and educational. In addition, the magazine provides a Teachers Guide and supplemental materials to help the teacher incorporate the material into the classroom in the best way possible. 

I believe by giving my students opportunities to read interesting non-fiction specifically intended for their age group, my students will be motivated to read and will concurrently be preparing themselves for their upcoming exam. Even once the exam is finished, reading this magazine will help my students develop the skills and confidence they need to read newspapers and other non-fiction. 

Getting this magazine for my kids would be an amazing gift, as most of my students don't otherwise have any opportunities to read magazines or newspapers. Also, because all students would receive their own copies, reading the magazine will be an even more exciting activity!"

My class will look at northern and southern dietary staples (such as noodles and rice, respectively), and prepare dishes that incorporate traditional Chinese cooking techniques.  We will need a refrigerator to store fresh ingredients, a hot plate, a wok, assorted pots and pans, cutting boards, mixing bowls, and tools for measuring.

Food is an amazing window into a culture. This experience will not only introduce students to Chinese ingredients and cooking techniques, but also to China's diverse history, belief systems, celebrations, and regional/cultural differences.
